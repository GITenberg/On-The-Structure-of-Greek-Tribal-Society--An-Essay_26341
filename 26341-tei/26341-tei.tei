<head>Preface</head>

<p>
These notes, brief as they are, owe more than can
be told to my father's researches into the structure
and methods of the Tribal System. They owe their
existence to his inspiration and encouragement. A
suitable place for them might possibly be found in
an Appendix to his recently published volume on
the Structure of the Tribal System in Wales.
</p>

<p>
In ascribing to the structure of Athenian Society
a direct parentage amongst tribal institutions, I am
dealing with a subject which I feel to be open to
considerable criticism. And I am anxious that the
matters considered in this essay should be judged
on their own merits, even though, in pursuing the
method adopted herein, I may have quite inadequately
laid the case before the reader.
</p>

<p>
My thanks are due, for their ready help, to
Professor W. Ridgeway, Mr. James W. Headlam,
and Mr. Henry Lee Warner, by means of whose
kind suggestions the following pages have been
weeded of several of their faults.
</p>

<p>
It is impossible to say how much I have consciously
or unconsciously absorbed from the works
<pb n="vi"/><anchor id="Pgvi"/>
of the late M. Fustel de Coulanges. His <hi rend='italic'>La Cité
Antique</hi> and his <hi rend='italic'>Nouvelles Recherches sur quelques
Problèmes d'Histoire</hi> (1891) are stores of suggestive
material for the student of Greek and Roman
customs. They are rendered all the more instructive
by the charm of his style and method. I
have merely dipped a bucket into his well.
</p>

<p>
In quoting from Homer, I have made free use
of the translations of Messrs. Lang, Leaf, and Myers
of the <hi rend='italic'>Iliad</hi>, and of Messrs. Butcher and Lang of
the <hi rend='italic'>Odyssey</hi>; and I wish to make full acknowledgment
here of the debt that I owe to them.
</p>

<p>
Some explanation seems to be needful of the
method pursued in this essay with regard to the
comparison of Greek customs with those of other
countries. The selection for comparison has been
entirely arbitrary.
</p>

<p>
Wales has been chosen to bear the brunt of
illustration, partly, as I have said, because of my
father's work on the Welsh Tribal System, partly
because the <hi rend='italic'>Ancient Laws of Wales</hi> afford a
peculiarly vivid glimpse into the inner organisation
of a tribal people, such as cannot be obtained
elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
The <hi rend='italic'>Ordinances of Manu</hi>, on the other hand,
are constantly quoted by writers on Greek institutions;
and, I suppose, in spite of the uncertainty
of their date, they can be taken as affording a very
fair account of the customs of a highly developed
Eastern people. It would be hard, moreover, to
<pb n="vii"/><anchor id="Pgvii"/>
say where the connection of the Greeks with the
East began or ended.
</p>

<p>
The use made of the <hi rend='italic'>Old Testament</hi> in these
notes hardly needs further remark. Of no people,
in their true tribal condition before their settlement,
have we a more graphic account than of the
Israelites. Their proximity geographically to the
Phœnicians, and the accounts of the widespread
fame of Solomon and the range of his commerce,
at once suggest comparison with the parallel and
contemporaneous period of Achaian history, immediately
preceding the Dorian invasion, when, if we
may trust the accounts of Homer, the intercourse
between the shores of the Mediterranean must have
been considerable.
</p>

<p>
All reference to records of Roman customs has
been omitted, not because they are not related or
analogous to the Greek, but because they could not
reasonably be brought within the scope of this
essay. The ancestor-worship among the Romans
was so complete, and the organisation of their
kindreds so highly developed, that they deserve
treatment on their own basis, and are sufficient to
form the subject of a separate volume.

[Transcriber's Note: This e-book contains much Greek text which is often
relevant to the point of the book.  In the ASCII versions of the e-book, the Greek
is transliterated into Roman letters, which do not perfectly represent the
Greek original; especially, accent and breathing marks do not transliterate.
The HTML and PDF versions contain the true Greek text of the original book.
In the ASCII e-book, the markings such as (M1) indicate marginal notes, which were
printed in the margins of the original book, but in the e-book are transcribed
at the end with the footnotes.]

<head>Chapter I. Introductory.</head>

<p>
<note place="margin">Vitality of the tribal system.</note>
In trying to ascertain the course of social development
among the Greeks, the inquirer is met by an
initial difficulty. The Greeks were not one great
people like the Israelites, migrating into and settling
in a new country, flowing with milk and honey.
Their movements were erratic and various, and took
place at very different times. Several partial migrations
are described in Homer, and others are referred to as
having taken place only a few generations back.
The continuation of unsettled life must have had the
effect of giving cohesion to the individual sections
into which the Greeks were divided, in proportion as
the process of settlement was protracted and difficult.
</p>

<p>
But in spite of divergencies caused by natural
surroundings, by the hostility or subservience of
previous occupants of the soil, there are some features
of the tribal system, wherever it is examined, so
inherent in its structure as to seem almost indelible.
A new civilisation was not formed to fit into the angles
of city walls. Even modification could take place
<pb n="002"/><anchor id="Pg002"/>
only of those customs whose roots did not strike too
deeply into the essence of the composition of tribal
society.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">Its survivals form the subject of this inquiry.</note>
It is the object of these notes to try to put back
in their true setting some of the conditions prevailing,
sometimes incongruously with city life, among the
Greeks in historical times, and by comparison with
analogous survivals in known tribal communities, of
whose condition we have fuller records, to establish
their real historical continuity from an earlier stage
of habit and belief.
</p>


<p>
<note place="margin">The centres of political and tribal society.</note>
There were three important public places necessary
to every Greek community and symbolical to the
Greek mind of the very foundations of their institutions.
These were:&mdash;the <hi rend='italic'>Agora</hi> or place of assembly,
the place of justice, and the place of religious sacrifice.
From these three sacred precincts the man who stirred
up civil strife, who was at war with his own people,
cut himself off. Such an one is described in Homer

to the Hestia and Prytaneum in the city of Athens as
the great centre of their larger polity. In just the
same way the lesser kindreds of a tribe would have their
sacred hearths and rites, but would look to the hearth
and person of their chief as symbolical of their tribal
unity. Thucydides also mentions how great a wrench
it seemed to the Athenians to be compelled to leave
their <q>sacred</q> homes, to take refuge within the walls of

maintained thereby its political importance,
when nothing but certain religious functions remained

Basileus.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">Their origin.</note>
Mr. Frazer, in his article in the
<hi rend='italic'>Journal of Philology</hi><note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Journal
of Philol.</hi> xiv. 145.</note> upon the resemblance of the Prytaneum in
Greece to the Temple of Vesta in Rome, shows that
both had a direct connection with, if not an absolute
origin in the domestic hearth of the chieftain. The
Lares and Penates worshipped in the Temple of Vesta,
he says, were originally the Lares and Penates of the
king, and were worshipped at his hearth, the only
difference between the hearth in the temple and the
hearth in the king's house being the absence of the
royal householder.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Op. cit.</hi> p. 153.</note>
</p>

<p>
Mr. Frazer also maintains that the reverence for
the hearth and the concentration of such reverence
on the hearth of the chieftain was the result of the
difficulty of kindling a fire from rubbing sticks together,
and of the responsibility thus devolving
upon the chieftain unfailingly to provide fire for
his people. Whether this was the origin or not,
before the times that come within the scope of this
inquiry, the hearth had acquired a real sanctity
which had become involved in the larger idea of it
as the centre of a kindred, including on occasion the
mysterious presence also of long dead ancestors.

<note place="margin">Qualification for share in

The basis of tribal coherence was community of

as <hi rend='italic'>one of a kindred</hi>, in the common religious

therefore in the incidence of religious duties, and in

to seek survivals of true tribal sentiment.
</p>

<p>
Although the religious life of the Greeks was
always complex, there is not to be found in Homer
the broad distinction drawn afterwards between
public and private gods. It is noticeable that the
later Greeks sought to draw into their homes the
beneficent influence of one or other of the greater
gods, whose protection and guidance were claimed in
times of need by all members of the household.
Secondary influences, though none the less strongly
felt, were those of the past heroes of the house,
sometimes only just dead, to be propitiated at the
family tombs or hearth. Anxiety on this head, and
the deeply-rooted belief in the real need to the dead
of attentions from the living, were, it will be seen,
most powerful factors in the development of Greek
society.
</p>


<p>
<note place="margin">Ancestor-worship not obvious in Homer.</note>
The worship of ancestors or household gods as
such is not evident in the visible religious exercises
of the Homeric poems. But this can hardly be a
matter of surprise. The Greek chieftains mentioned
in the poems are so nearly descended from the
gods themselves, are in such immediate relation each
with his guardian deity, and are so indefatigable
in their attentions thereto, that it would surely be
<pb n="006"/><anchor id="Pg006"/>
extremely irrelevant if any of the libations or
hecatombs were perverted to any intermediate, however
heroic, ancestor from the all-powerful and ever
ready divinity who was so often also himself the
boasted founder of the family.<note place="foot">Plato (<hi rend='italic'>Laws</hi>

the belief in the existence of the gods was a reasonable one, seeing
that at that time most men were sons of gods.</note>
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">Offerings of food to the gods,</note>
The libations and hecatombs themselves, however,
seem to serve much the same purpose as the offerings
to the <hi rend='italic'>manes</hi> or household gods, and relieved the
luxurious craving for sustenance in the immortals,
left unsatisfied by their ethereal diet of nectar and

<p>
Is the right conclusion then that the Homeric
Greeks did not sacrifice at the tombs of their fathers,
and that the so-called ancestor-worship prevalent later
was introduced or revived under their successors? Or
is it that the aristocratic tone of the poet did not
permit him to bear witness to the intercourse with
any deity besides the one great family of Olympic
gods, less venerable than a river or other personification
of nature?<note place="foot">The speculative state of mind

<p>
There exists such close family relationship amongst
Homer's gods, extended as it is also to most of his
chieftains, that taking into account the conspicuous
<pb n="008"/><anchor id="Pg008"/>
reverence displayed towards the hearth and the
respect for seniority in age, it may perhaps be
justifiable to suppose that domestic religious observances,
other than those directed to the Olympic gods,
were thought by the poet to be as much beneath his
notice as the swarms of common tribesmen who
shrink and shudder in the background of the poems.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">Offerings to the dead in the Old Testament.</note>
Ancestor-worship would be as much out of place
in the Old Testament; and yet there are references
in the Bible to offerings to the dead which, unless they
are held to refer only to importations from outside
religions and not to relapses in the Israelites themselves
to former superstitions of their own people, imply
that the great tribal religion of the Israelites had superseded
pre-existing ceremonies of ancestor-worship.
</p>

<quote rend="display">
Deut. xxvi. 13. <q>And thou shalt say before the Lord thy God,
I have brought away the hallowed things out of mine house, and
also have given them unto the Levite and the stranger, to the

which thou hast commanded me: I have not transgressed thy
commandments, neither have I forgotten them: I have not eaten

</p>

<p>
It was not necessary for an ancestor to become
a god to be worthy of worship, or to need the
attentions of the living. If he was thought to haunt
tomb or hearth, and to keep his connection thus
with his family in the upper world, he required
nourishment on his visits. He was also considered
<pb n="009"/><anchor id="Pg009"/>
to keep a jealous watch on the continuance of his
fair fame among the living.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">Resemblance between Homer and the Old Testament.</note>
A close resemblance in this point lies between
the Homeric poems and the Old Testament. Though
actual food and drink is not provided for the dead,
yet the stress laid on the permanence of the family,
<hi rend='italic'>lest the name of the dead be cut off from his place</hi>,
is quite in keeping with the request of Elpenor to
Odysseus to insure the continuance of his name in
the memory of living men.
</p>

<p>
It is quite possible that, as the story of the interview
of Odysseus with the dead reveals that the idea of
the dead enjoying sacrifices of food and drink was
familiar at that time, even though the periodical supply
of such is not mentioned, so the existence of Laban's
household gods and the gathering of the kindred of
Jesse to their family ceremony<note place="foot">1 Sam. xx. 6.
Θυσία τῶν ἡμερῶν ἐκεῖ ὅλῃ τῇ φυλῇ.</note> may bear witness to
the presence of a survival of ancestor-worship in some
equivalent form, underlying the all-absorbing religion
of the Israelites. At this day the spirits of Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob are considered by the Mohammedans
of Hebron actually to inhabit the cave of Machpelah,
and, in the case of Isaac at any rate, to be extremely
angered by any negligence shown to their altars,
either by omission of the customary ceremonies or by
admission within the sacred precinct of any stranger
of alien faith.
</p>

<p>
It must not therefore be inferred altogether that
the regular ancestor-worship so-called was of later
origin amongst the Greeks, but rather that the constitution
of society did not afford it the same
<pb n="010"/><anchor id="Pg010"/>
prominence to the mind of Homer and perhaps his
contemporaries, as it acquired later.

In the next chapters frequent reference will be

the ancient Hindoos. With them the cake-offering
to the dead became a most important symbol, uniting

the matter of responsibility thereto from more distant
relations, who owed similar duty elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">Ancestor-worship not necessarily post-Homeric.</note>
Being thus surrounded by nations that believed
intensely in the need in the dead of nourishment at
the hands of their relatives on earth, it would indeed
be surprising if the Greeks were found not to share in
the belief. But the fact remains that in the earliest
Greek literature it is least conspicuous, and the gulf
seems widest between the living and the dead. Can
this be laid to the charge of the artificial superstitions
of a philosophical class of poets? Or is it due to the
true evolution of such beliefs, that as long as our
search touches upon the unsettled periods of semi-migratory
life, the tombs of individual members of a
family being scattered here or there wherever they
meet their deaths, the offering to the dead takes a
special form, inasmuch as the solidarity of the tribe
eclipses the importance of the family as a unit, and
the religious ceremonies of the chieftain absorb the
attention of the lesser members of the tribe?
</p>

<p>
M. de Coulanges points out that the meaning of
the Latin word <hi rend='italic'>Lar</hi> is lord, prince or master, and
<pb n="013"/><anchor id="Pg013"/>
that <hi rend='italic'>Hestia</hi> was sometimes designated by the Greeks
with the similar title of mistress of the house, or
princess.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Cité Antique</hi>, p. 93, ἑστία
δέσποινα.</note>
</p>

<p>
If, as long as the tribe was felt to be a real unit,
the religious instincts of the tribesmen were concentrated
upon the worship of their tribal deities&mdash;the
great ancestors of the tribe, and more emphatically
and directly the ancestors of their chieftain&mdash;it would
be quite natural, in the weakening of the central worship,
for the titles of honour and respect to be used
equally towards those meaner ancestors who henceforth
occupied the religious energies of the head of
each family or household. In fulfilment of a similar
sentiment, the later Greeks commonly used the word
ἥρως in speaking of a dead friend, deeming that any
one who departed this life passed to the ranks of
those princes of the community from whom all were
proud to trace descent.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">The hearth and the tie of common blood.</note>
M. de Coulanges considers that the sacred rites of
the family at the hearth formed a more real tie than
the belief in a common blood; and that upon this
religious basis was built up the greater hearth of the
Prytaneum as the centre of city life, to bind together
the several families composing the community. But
without pretending to come to a final decision on
this the main tendency of social development, surely
something may yet be said in favour of the contrary
theory; that the reverence that centred in the hearth
was in effect the expression of the sanctity of the tie
of blood, as felt by all members of the house, and that
this feeling drew its real importance for the community,
<pb n="014"/><anchor id="Pg014"/>
not from the founding of the city by the
amalgamation of several families, but as a survival
from an earlier stage of life, when society circled
round what was then in more than name the Prytaneum
of the tribal chieftain.
</p>

<p>
Facts are wanting to justify a conclusion as to
which of these theories bears the closest resemblance
to the truth, but it is easy to imagine what might
be the line of development if the latter hypothesis be
maintained.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">Possible course of social development.</note>
During the wanderings and migrations of peoples
in the search for greener pastures or broader lands,
each community or tribe would be constantly under
arms and subject to attack from the enemies they
were passing through or subjugating. This constant
sojourning in a strange land, surrounded by foes,
would be a source of much solidarity to the tribe
itself, drawing its members closely together for
mutual defence and subsistence.
</p>

<p>
But when once the tribe had found a country to
its taste, and had made a settlement with borders comparatively
permanently established, emphasis would
be transferred to the petty quarrels and internal dissensions
arising between different sections within the
community itself. The tie of common blood, uniting
all members of the tribe, would be gradually disregarded
and displaced by the less homely and more
political relation of fellow-citizenship, which, though
retaining many of the characteristics of the tribal
bond, would necessarily be felt in a very different
manner.
</p>

<p>
In this disintegration of the larger unit, the
existence of kinship by blood would be acknowledged
<pb n="015"/><anchor id="Pg015"/>
only where the relationship was obvious and well
known. And it would no longer be sufficient merely
to prove membership of a kindred; as those outside
certain limits would claim exemption from the
responsibilities entailed by closer relationship.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">The change of tribesmen into citizens.</note>
So, too, in the matter of religious observance:
the reverence of the individual for the Prytaneum
and common hearth of the state would undergo a
change into a less personal sentiment; the rites
connected therewith would be delegated to an official
priest; and it is with the head of each family, surrounded
by those who are really conscious of their
connection by blood in common descent from much
more immediate ancestors, that the true tribal feeling
would longest survive, though, of course, on much
narrower lines.
</p>

<p>
The privileges of citizenship were, it will be seen,
as carefully guarded as those of the tribe, but in a
more perfunctory and arbitrary manner; whilst the
intimate connection of the members of the family
with the hearth and the graves of their ancestors
stands out in strong relief.

<head>§ 1. The Duty Of Maintenance Of Parents During
Life, And After Death At Their Tomb.</head>

<p>
<note place="margin">The duties of the individual to his οἶκος,</note>
As the hearth was the centre of the sanctity and
reverence of the family, so the word οἶκος was the customary
term to signify the smaller group of the composite
γένος, consisting of a man and his immediate
descendants. In the first place, the individual was
absolutely committed to sacrifice all his personal feelings
for the sake of the continuity of his οἶκος, and this
was his supreme duty. But whereas several οἶκοι
traced their descent from a common ancestor, a
group of gradually diverging lines of descent
were formed, sharing mutually the responsibility
of the maintenance of continuity, and the privilege
of inheritance and protection.
</p>

<p>
Before examining how far these parallel lines
remained within the reach of claims of kinship, or
how soon the reverence for the more immediate predecessors
<pb n="018"/><anchor id="Pg018"/>
absorbed the memory of the more remote
ancestor, it will be well to have a clear understanding
of what the claims of kindred were, and how they
affected the member of the οἶκος, in respect of his
duties thereto.

His duties to his ancestors began with the death
of his father. He had at Athens to carry out the

and show respect to the dead by the

clothes, and so on. Nine days after the funeral he
must perform certain sacrifices and periodically after
that visit the tombs and altars of his family in the
family burying-place.<note place="foot">Dem. <hi rend='italic'>c. Macart.</hi>

Before he can enter into his inheritance
he must fulfil all the ordinances incumbent on one

<p>
<note place="margin">The importance of male succession.</note>
The procreation of children was held to be of such
importance at Sparta<note place="foot">Plut. <hi rend='italic'>Lycurg. and Numa</hi> 4.
Xen. <hi rend='italic'>Rep. Lac.</hi> i. 7 to 9.</note> that if a wife had no children,
with the full knowledge of her husband she admitted
some other citizen to her, and children born from
such a union were reckoned as born to the continuation
of her husband's family, without breach of the
former relations of husband and wife.<note place="foot">From Xen.
<hi rend='italic'>Rep. Lac.</hi> i. 9, it would seem that such children,
born into a family where there were already children of both
father and mother, had no share in the family property.</note> This is the
exact custom stated in the <hi rend='italic'>Ordinances of Manu</hi>
<pb n="022"/><anchor id="Pg022"/>
(ix. 59), where it is laid down that a wife can be
<q>commissioned</q> by her husband to bear him a son,
but she must only take a kinsman within certain
degrees, whose connection with her ceases on the birth
of one son.<note place="foot">This was the practice also in
Arabia (Rob. Smith, <hi rend='italic'>Kinship &amp;c.</hi>,

divorce the first, and could not have two hearths or
two wives.<note place="foot">Herod. v. 40.</note>
</p>

<p>
A curious instance of how this sentiment worked
in practice in directly the opposite direction to
our modern ideas, is mentioned in Herodotus.
Leaders of forlorn hopes nowadays would be inclined
to pick out as comrades the unmarried men, as
having least to sacrifice and fewest duties to forego.
Whereas Leonidas, in choosing the 300 men to make
their famous and fatal stand at Thermopylae, is stated
to have selected all <emph>fathers with sons living</emph>.<note place="foot">Herod.

</p>

<p>
Where children were reckoned of the tribe of
their father and not of their mother, and where a
woman was incapable of performing sacred rites, a male
heir was necessary for the direct transmission of blood
and property. Sons entered upon their inheritance
immediately on the death of their father, nor had he
the power to dispossess them in favour of others,
whilst brothers, cousins, legatees, had always to prove
their title and procure judgment from the court in
their favour.<note place="foot">Is. iii. 59 and 60, vi. 28.</note>
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">Succession through a daughter.</note>
Failing sons however, the next descent lay through
a daughter. Nor were her qualifications in herself
complete or sufficient in theory to form the necessary
link in the chain of succession. The next of kin

she was ἐπίκληρος;<note place="foot">For want of a better translation
implying <q>going with the property</q> this word will be rendered

certain age. The next of kin had in the meantime
of course to represent his wife's father in
all the religious observances, and was said to have
power to live with the woman (κύριος συνοικῆσαι
τῇ γυναικί), but not to dispose of the property
(κύριος τῶν χρημάτων);<note place="foot">Is. viii. 31. <hi rend='italic'>Cf.</hi>

<head>§ 3. The Position Of The Widow Without Child
And The Duties Of An Only Daughter.</head>

<p>
<note place="margin">The levirate proper not found in Greece.</note>
The <hi rend='italic'>levirate</hi>, or marriage with deceased husband's
brother, seems to have had no place in Greek family
law. The wife was of no <emph>kin</emph> necessarily to the
husband; and so it would not tend to strengthen the
transmission of blood if the next of kin married the
widow on taking the inheritance of his relative
deceased without issue. The wife in Greek law could
not inherit from her husband, whose property went
to his father's or mother's relations; and only when
it became a question of finding an heir to her <emph>son</emph>,
and failing all near paternal kinsmen, could the
<pb n="028"/><anchor id="Pg028"/>
inheritance pass through her, and then as the mother
of her dead son, not as widow of her dead husband.
Even then, being a woman, she had no right of enjoyment,
only of transmission. She could only inherit
on behalf of her issue by a second husband, and
failing her issue the inheritance would pass to her
brothers and so on. In Greece the claim upon the
δαήρ (Latin <hi rend='italic'>levir</hi>) for marriage seems to have begun
with his brother's daughter, not his brother's widow.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">The widow returned to her guardian.</note>

<p>
Isaeus<note place="foot">vii. 11 and 12.</note> mentions that it was thought quite
natural for a man to marry his first cousin in order

going outside his οἶκος, and we know that even
marriage with a half-sister (not born of the same

<p>
There are more instances than one in Homer of a

<p>
The nearest resemblance to the levirate in Greece
is the occasional custom at Sparta, mentioned already,
of a wife being <q>commissioned</q> to bear children by

Such was the scorn felt for the man who refused
to perform the duties of nearest kinsman. In the

Tamar, the wife of Judah's eldest son who died childless.
The second son's refusal to raise up seed to his
brother because he knows that <emph>his own name will not

summary punishment. <q>And the thing that he did
was evil in the sight of the Lord, and He slew him
also.</q><note place="foot">Gen. xxxviii. 10.</note>
Afterwards, when it was reported to her

<q>Bring her forth and let her be burnt.</q> Accordingly,
after he had received his own <q>tokens</q> from her hand,
<pb n="031"/><anchor id="Pg031"/>
his approval of her action, in her desire to perpetuate
the name of her dead husband, is all the more
striking, and shows how real such a claim as Tamar's
was in the practice of those days, extreme though
her action was felt to be. And Judah acknowledged
his tokens and said, <q>She hath been more righteous
than I: because that I gave her not to Shelah my
[youngest] son.</q>
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">The case of Ruth.</note>
The statement of the customary procedure in
Deuteronomy is very picturesquely illustrated and
fulfilled in detail in the story of Ruth, who though
only a daughter-in-law takes the position of heiress
through a sort of adoption by her mother-in-law
Naomi, on her refusal to go back to her own people.
<q>Where thou goest, I will go: where thou lodgest, I
will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy
God, my God. Where thou diest will I die, and
there will I be buried.</q> She accepts Naomi's hearth
her kin, her religion, and finally her tomb.
</p>

<p>
Elimelech and his two sons dying in Moab, Naomi
and both her daughters-in-law are left widows in a
strange land. If Naomi had other sons, upon them
would have devolved the duty of taking Orpah and
Ruth to wife. But Naomi declares herself<note place="foot">Ruth i. 8-12.</note>
too old to marry again and be the mother of sons, and implores
her daughters-in-law to return to their own people in
Moab, where she hopes they will start afresh with
new husbands, a course which seems always to have
been open to wives in tribal communities. Orpah
does so, but Ruth elects to remain with Naomi, and
returning with her to Bethlehem takes her chance
<pb n="032"/><anchor id="Pg032"/>
among the kindred of Elimelech. Happening to
arrive at Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley
harvest, it so chances that Ruth goes forth to glean
upon that part of the open field which belonged to
Boaz&mdash;a rich man of the συγγενία of Elimelech, who,
having heard of her devotion to Naomi and the house
of his late kinsmen, protects her from possible insult
from strangers and treats her richly. On her return
home Naomi informs her that Boaz is of their next
of kin (τῶν ἀγχιστευόντων)<note place="foot">For the meaning of ἀγχιστεύς see below
p. <ref target="Pg055">55</ref>.</note> whose place it was to
redeem property sold or lost by a kinsman. This
duty is thus set forth in Leviticus:&mdash;
</p>

<quote rend="display">
<note place="margin">Dependence on the next of kin.</note>
Lev. xxv. 25. <q>And if thy brother be waxen poor and sell
some of his possession, then shall his kinsman (ἀγχιστεύων) that is
next to him come and shall redeem that which his brother hath
sold.</q>
</quote>

<p>
An instance of it in practice is given in Jeremiah.
</p>

<quote rend="display">
Jerem. xxxii. 8. <q>So Hanameel mine uncle's son came to me
in the court of the guard according to the word of the Lord and
said unto me, <q>Buy my field, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth which
is in the land of Bethlehem: for the right of inheritance is thine,
and the redemption is thine: buy it for thyself.</q></q>
</quote>

<p>
But on Ruth's applying to Boaz, he informs her
that though he is ἀγχιστεύς, <hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi> within the reach of the
claim on the next of kin, yet is there one ἀγχιστεύς
who is nearer than he, and who must first be asked.
</p>

<quote rend="display">
<q>Now Boaz went up to the gate and sat down there, and behold
the near kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by, unto whom
he said, <q>Ho, such an one! turn, aside, sit down here,</q> and he
turned aside and sat down. And he took ten men of the elders
of the city and said, <q>Sit ye down here,</q> and they sat down. And
<pb n="033"/><anchor id="Pg033"/>
he said unto the near kinsman, <q>Naomi that is come again out of
the country of Moab selleth the parcel of land which was our
brother Ehmelech's: and I thought to disclose it to thee, saying,
<q>Buy it before them that sit here and before the elders of my
people.</q> If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it; but if thou wilt not
redeem it, tell me that I may know; for there is none to redeem it
beside thee, and I am after thee.</q> And he said, <q>I will redeem it.</q>
Then said Boaz, <q>What day thou buyest the field of the hand of
Naomi thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, <emph>the wife of the
dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance</emph>.</q> And
the near kinsman said, <q>I cannot redeem it for myself <emph>lest I mar
my own inheritance</emph>; take thou my right of redemption on thee; for
I cannot redeem it.</q></q>
</quote>

<p>
The rendering of the Vulgate of the kinsman's
reply is more easily understood:&mdash;<q>I yield up my
right of near kinship: for neither ought I to blot out the
continuance (<hi rend='italic'>posteritas</hi>) of my family: do thou use
my privilege, which I declare that I freely renounce.</q>
</p>

<quote rend="display">
<q>And he drew off his shoe. And Boaz said unto the elders and
unto all the people, <q>Ye are witnesses this day that I have bought
all that was Elimelech's ... Chilion's and Mahlon's of the hand of
Naomi. Moreover Ruth, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to
be my wife to <emph>raise up the name of the dead</emph> upon his inheritance,
that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his
brethren and from the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this
day.</q> And all the people that were in the gate and the elders
said, <q>We are witnesses ... May thy house be like the house of
Perez whom Tamar bare unto Judah</q> &amp;c.</q>
</quote>

<p>
Now Boaz was sixth in descent from this Perez
whose mother Tamar, as quoted above, had been in
much the same position as Ruth.
</p>

<p>
It is interesting to read further that the son born
of this marriage of Ruth and Boaz is taken by the
women of Bethlehem to Naomi, saying, <q><emph>There is a
son born to Naomi</emph>,</q> emphasising the duty of the
heiress to bear a son, not into her husband's family,
but to that of her father.
</p>

<pb n="034"/><anchor id="Pg034"/>

<p>
The story of Ruth is not, therefore, an exact
example of the custom of levirate. But it illustrates
incidentally the unity of the family. The sons of
Elimelech died before the family division had taken
place, and the house of Elimelech their father was
thus in jeopardy of extinction. If Naomi had come
within the proper operation of the levirate, the next
of kin ought to have married <emph>her</emph>, but by her adoption
of Ruth as her daughter, she gave Ruth the position
of heiress or ἐπίκληρος, whilst the heir born to Ruth
was called son, not of Ruth's former or present husband,
but of Elimelech and (by courtesy) of Naomi, Elimelech's
widow, through whom the issue ought otherwise
to have been found.

But if the heiress was already married and had
sons, she need not be divorced and marry the next of

absolutely: her son must entirely leave her husband's

the conduct of married sisters
in not appointing one of their own sons to take his

and in absorbing the property into that of their
husbands, whereby the οἶκος of their brother became
ἔρημος, is described as shameful (αἰσχρῶς).
</p>

<p>
In Demosthenes<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>c. Macart.</hi> 1077.</note>
a man behaving in similar wise
is stigmatised as ὑβριστής.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">Hence the custom of adoption.</note>
Herein lay the reason that adoption became so
favourite a means in classical times of securing an
heir. It became almost a habit among the Athenians
who had no sons, to adopt an heir&mdash;often even the
next of kin who would naturally have succeeded to
the inheritance.<note place="foot">Dem. <hi rend='italic'>c. Leochar.</hi> 1093. ἐκ
τῶν κατὰ γένος ἐγγυτάτω εἰσποιεῖν υἱὸν τῷ τετελευτηκότι ὅπως ἄν ὁ
οἶκος μὴ ἐξερημωθῇ.</note>
</p>

<p>
The transfer of the adopted son from the οἶκος of
his father to the οἶκος he was chosen to represent
was so real that he lost all claim to inheritance in his
original family, and henceforth based his relationship
and rights of kinship from his new position as son of
his adoptive father. This absolutely insured the childless
man that his successor would not merge the
inheritance in that of another οἶκος, and made it
extremely unlikely that he would neglect his religious
duties as they would be henceforth his own ancestral
rites.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, it seems,<note place="foot">Is. x. 17.</note> sons of an unfortunate
<pb n="036"/><anchor id="Pg036"/>
father were adopted into another οἶκος so as not to
share in the disgrace brought upon their family.
In such a case presumably their father's house would
be allowed to become extinct.

<p>
<note place="margin">The introduction of the heir to the kindred.</note>

to the heirship,<note place="foot">Arist. <hi rend='italic'>Pol.</hi> 1, 2, 4 Ἡ κτῆσις

of an introduction to the kindred and to the ancestral
altars, and an assumption of the responsibilities
connected therewith.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">The same for true as for adopted son.</note>
The process was the same as for the proclamation
of the true blood of a son, and was exactly in accordance
with tribal instincts.
</p>

<p>
Whatever the history of the φρατρία at Athens,
in it seems to have been accumulated a great number
of the survivals of tribal sentiment.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">The ceremony at Athens;</note>
The adoption at Athens took place at the gathering
of the phratores in order that all the kin might be
present (παρόντων τῶν συγγενῶν).<note place="foot">Is. ii. 14.</note> The adopter must
lead his son to the sacrifices on the altars<note place="foot">Is. vii. 1, 16, 13
and 27.</note> and must
show him to the kinsmen (συγγενεῖς or γεννῆται) and
phratores: he must give assurance on the sacrifices
that the young man was born in lawful wedlock from
free citizens. This done, and no one questioning his
rights, the assembly proceeded to vote<note place="foot">Dem. <hi rend='italic'>c.
Eubulid.</hi> 1315.</note> and if the vote
was in his favour, then and not till then he was enrolled
in the common register (εἰς τὸ κοινὸν γραμματεῖον) of
the phratria in the name of son of his adopted father.
As a father could not without reason disinherit his
true-born sons, so the phratores could not without
reason refuse to accept them to the kinship.<note place="foot">Is. vi. 25.</note>
</p>

<pb n="037"/><anchor id="Pg037"/>

<p>
If any of the phratores objected to the admission
of the new kinsman, he must stop the sacrifices and
remove the victim from the altar.<note place="foot">Andoc. <hi rend='italic'>de
Myst.</hi> 126.</note> He would have
to state the grounds of his objection, and if he could
not produce good reasons, he incurred a fine. If there
was no objection, the unsacrificial parts of the victim
were divided up and each member took home with
him his share,<note place="foot">Dem. <hi rend='italic'>c. Macart.</hi> 1054 and
1078.</note> or joined in a feast provided by the
father of the admitted son.<note place="foot">Dem. <hi rend='italic'>c. Leoch.</hi>

similar:&mdash;
</p>

<quote rend="display">
x. 33. <q>The adoption shall take place in the agora when all the

made. And the adopter shall give to his own brotherhood

<p>
The adopted son gets all the property and shall
fulfil the divine and human duties of his adoptive
father<note place="foot">Isaeus ix. 7 (<hi rend='italic'>Astyph.</hi>)

and shall inherit as in the law for true-born
sons. But if he does not fulfil them according to
law, the next of kin shall take the property. He can
only renounce his adoption by paying a fine.
</p>

<p>
The adopted son thus introduced was considered
to have become of the blood of his adoptive father,
and was unable to leave his new family and return to
his original home unless he left in the adoptive
house a son to carry on the name to posterity. As
long as he remained in the other οἶκος, <hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi> had not
provided for his succession and by certain legal

</p>

The introduction into the deme which took place at
the age of eighteen at Athens, including the enrolment

away to Delphi to have his hair cut (ἀποκεῖραι),</q>
showing that this venerable custom had by that time
become pedantic and an object of ridicule.
</p>

<p>
According to Athenaeus,<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Deipnosoph.</hi> xi.
88.</note> when the young men
cut their hair they brought a large cup of wine to
Herakles and, pouring a libation, offered it to the
assembled people to drink.
</p>

<p>
The age at which the hair was cut seems to have
varied. The <hi rend='italic'>Ordinances of
Manu</hi><note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Manu</hi> ii. 65.</note> give the following
instructions:&mdash;
</p>

<quote rend="display">
<q>The Keçanta (tonsure-rite) is ordered in the sixteenth
year<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Cf.</hi> ii. 38. This was the last
year that a Brahman could receive investiture.</note>
of a Brahman, in the twenty-second of a Ksatriya, and in two years
more after that for a Vaiçya.</q>
</quote>

<p>
But whenever the actual tonsure was performed,
it seems to have been a very widely spread custom,
symbolical in some way of devotion to a deity or
kindred, or to some particular course of life.
</p>

<p>
Its importance in this place, however, lies in its
being one of the special acts relating to the admission
to tribal status, and to the devotion, so to speak, of
the services of the individual to the corporate needs
of his tribe or kindred.
</p>

<p>
The public introduction to the kindred, combined
<pb n="041"/><anchor id="Pg041"/>
with publicity of marriage and of the birth of
children would, it is obvious, be a very important
protection for the preservation of the jealously
guarded purity of the tribal blood. Isaeus<note place="foot">Isaeus, vi. 10.</note> says
that all relations (προσήκοντες), all the phratores, and
most (οἱ πολλοί) of the demesmen would know whom
a man married, and what children he had. This, in
addition to the oath (πίστις) of the father or of the
mother<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Anc. Grk. Inscr.</hi> Brit. Mus.
cccxv. cccxvii. and cccxviii. Oath of mother required before legitimacy

his kin, would seem a very sufficient
safeguard.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Cf.</hi> Aristot. <hi rend='italic'>Ath.

</p>

<head>§ 5. The Liability For Bloodshed.</head>

<p>
<note place="margin">Liability for bloodshed rested on a group of kinsmen.</note>
A notable feature of the tribal system all over the
world was the <hi rend='italic'>blood-feud</hi>, wiped out only by the death
of the manslayer or by the payment of a sufficient
recompense. The incidence of the responsibility for
murder and for payment of the recompense upon a
group instead of only on the guilty individual was of
remarkable tenacity, and survived to comparatively
late days.
</p>

<p>
In Arabia the whole tribe of the murderer subscribed
to the blood-money, which went to all the
males in the tribe of the murdered man.<note place="foot">Robertson Smith,

<p>
But in Greece the responsibility fell upon the next
of kin, with the help and under the supervision of the
rest of the immediate kindred. He had to see that a
spear was carried in front of the funeral of the slain
man and planted in his grave, which must be watched
for three days.<note place="foot">Dem. <hi rend='italic'>in Euerg.</hi> and
<hi rend='italic'>Mnesib.</hi> 1160.</note> He must make proclamation of the
foul deed at the tomb, and must undergo purificatory
rites, himself and his whole house (οἰκία). If the

death known, the demarch must compel the relatives
to bury the corpse and to purify the deme on the

<head>§ 1. Degrees Of Blood-Relationship; The Ἀγχιστεία.</head>

<p>
<note place="margin">All kinsmen were not equally responsible.</note>
Such being the character of the burden of mutual
responsibility borne by members of kindred blood, it
remains, if possible, to obtain some idea of how this
responsibility became narrowed and limited to the
nearest relations, and what was the meaning underlying
the distinction drawn between certain degrees
of relationship.
</p>

<p>
When examining the more detailed structure of
the organisation of the kindred, considerable light
seems to be thrown upon survivals in Athens by
comparison with the customs of other communities,
which were undergoing earlier stages of the same
process of crystallisation from the condition of semi-nomadic
tribes into that of settled provinces or
kingdoms.
</p>

<pb n="047"/><anchor id="Pg047"/>

<p>
<note place="margin">The unity of the οἶκος.</note>
In the Gortyn Laws we read:&mdash;
</p>

<quote rend="display">
iv. 24. <q>The father shall have power over the children and the
property to divide it amongst them.... As long as they (the
parents) are alive, <emph>there is no necessity for division</emph>.... If a man or
woman die their children, or grandchildren, or great-grandchildren,
shall have the property....</q>
</quote>

<p>
The headship of the οἶκος and the ownership of the
property vested in the parent as long as he lived and
wished to maintain his power. Even after his death,
unless they wished it, the sons need not divide up
amongst themselves, but could live on with joint
ownership in the one οἶκος of their deceased father.
The eldest son would probably take the house itself,
<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi> the hearth, with the duties to the family altars
which devolved upon him as head of the family.<note place="foot">v.
<hi rend='italic'>infra</hi> p. <ref target="Pg090">90</ref> <hi rend='italic'>et
seq.</hi></note>
</p>

<p>
An example of this joint ownership occurs in the
speech of Demosthenes against Leochares.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>c.
Leoch.</hi> 1083.</note> The two
sons of Euthumachos after his death gave their sister
in marriage (no doubt with her proper portion), and
lived separately but <emph>without dividing</emph> their inheritance
(τὴν οὐσίαν ἀνέμητον). Even after the marriage of one
brother, they still left the property undivided, each
living on his share of the income, one in Athens, the
other in Salamis.
</p>

<p>
The possibility of thus living in one οἶκος and on
an undivided patrimony is implied in another passage
in Demosthenes, where, however, the exact opposite
is described as actually having taken place.<note place="foot">Dem. <hi rend='italic'>c.
Macart.</hi> 1055-6.</note>
</p>

<p>
Bouselos had five sons. He divided (διένειμεν τὴν
οὐσίαν) his substance amongst them all as was fair and
right, and they married wives and begat children and
<pb n="048"/><anchor id="Pg048"/>
children's children. Thus <emph>five</emph> οἶκοι sprang up out of
the one of Bouselos, and <emph>each brother dwelt apart</emph>,
having his own οἶκος and bringing up his own offspring
(ἔκγονοι) himself (χωρὶς ἕκαστος ᾤκει).
</p>

<p>
Whilst the parents were alive the family naturally
held very closely together, and often probably lived
in one patriarchal household like Priam's at Troy.
</p>

<p>
Isaeus declares:&mdash;The law commands that we
maintain (τρέφειν) our parents (γονεῖς): these are&mdash;parents,
grandparents and <emph>their parents</emph>, if they are
still alive:
</p>

<quote rend="display">
<q>For they are the beginning (ἀρχή) of the family (γένος) and
their estate descends to their offspring (ἔκγονοι): wherefore it is
necessary to maintain them even if they leave nothing.</q><note place="foot">Isaeus,
viii. 32.</note>
</quote>

<p>
The duty of maintenance (τρέφειν) owed to the
ancestor would follow the same relationship as the
right of inheritance from him, and this common debt
towards their living forebears could not help further
consolidating the group of descendants already bound
together by common rites at the tombs of the dead.
</p>

<p>
But granted this community of rights and debts,
is it possible to formulate for the Greeks anything of
the same limitations in the incidence of responsibility
amongst blood-relations that is to be found elsewhere?
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">Grades of kinship in Western Europe.</note>
In western Europe, owing perhaps to the influence
of Christianity, the rites of ancestor-worship
have no prominence. Ecclesiastical influence however
was unable to prevent an exceedingly complex
subdivision of the kindred existing in Wales and
elsewhere. Whether this subdivision finds its <hi rend='italic'>raison
d'être</hi> in the worship of ancestors or not, the groups
<pb n="049"/><anchor id="Pg049"/>
thus formed serve as units for sustaining the responsibilities
incident to tribal life, and being, as will be
seen, governed by similar considerations to those
existing among the Greeks, they afford very suitable
material for comparison, and throw considerable light
upon one another.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">The position of the great-grandson,</note>
As the various departments affected by blood-relationship
or purity of descent come under notice,
it will be seen that the position of <emph>great-grandson</emph>
as at once limiting the immediate family of his
parents and heading a new family of descendants is
marked with peculiar emphasis.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">in Wales,</note>
In the ancient laws of Wales it rests with great-grandsons
to make the final division of their inheritance
and start new households.
</p>

<p>
Second cousins may demand redivision of the
heritage descending (and perhaps already divided
up in each generation between) from their great-grandfather.
After second cousins no redivision or
co-equation can be claimed.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Venedotian Code</hi>,
ii. xii.</note>
</p>

<p>
In the meanwhile the oldest living parents maintained
their influence in family matters. In the story
of Kilhwch and Olwen, in the <hi rend='italic'>Mabinogion</hi>, the father
of Olwen, before betrothing her to Kilhwch, declares
that <q>her four great-grandmothers and her four great-grandsires
are yet alive; it is needful that I take
counsel of them.</q><note place="foot">Lady Charlotte Guest's
<hi rend='italic'>Mabinogion</hi>, p. 234.</note>
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">and in feudal Normandy.</note>
Even when feudalism refused to acknowledge
other than an individual responsibility for a fief, it
was unable to overcome the tribal theory of the
<pb n="050"/><anchor id="Pg050"/>
indivisibility of the family, which maintained its unity
in some places even under a feudal exterior. But as
generations proceeded, and the relationships within
the family diverged beyond the degree of second
cousin, a natural breaking up seems to have taken
place, though in the direction of subinfeudation under
the feudal enforcement of the rule of primogeniture,
instead of the practice, more in accordance with
tribal instincts, of equal division and enfranchisement.
It may however be surmised that the subdivision
and subinfeudation of a holding in the occupation
of such a group of kinsmen would be carried
out by the formation of further similar groups.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">The custom of <hi rend='italic'>parage</hi>.</note>
In the <hi rend='italic'>Coustumes du Pais de Normandie</hi> mention
is made of such a method of land-holding, called
<hi rend='italic'>parage</hi>. It consists of an undivided tenure of
brothers and relations <emph>within the degree of second
cousins</emph>.
</p>

<p>
The eldest does homage to the capital lord for all
the <hi rend='italic'>paragers</hi>. The younger and their descendants
hold of the eldest without homage, until the relationship
comes to the <emph>sixth degree inclusive</emph> (<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi> second
cousins). When the lineage is beyond the sixth
degree, the heirs of the cadets have to do homage to
the heirs of the eldest or to whomsoever has acquired
the fief. Then <hi rend='italic'>parage</hi>
ceases.<note place="foot">cxxviii-cxxxi.</note>
</p>

<p>
The tenure then becomes one of subinfeudation.
As long as the <hi rend='italic'>parage</hi> continued, the share of a
deceased <hi rend='italic'>parager</hi> would be dealt with by redivision
of rights, and no question would arise of
finding heirs. But when it became a question of
<pb n="051"/><anchor id="Pg051"/>
finding an heir to the group, failing heirs in the
seventh degree inclusive, that is, son of second
cousins&mdash;looked upon as son to the group&mdash;failing
such an heir, the estate escheated to the lord.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">Co-heritage in Wales.</note>
There is an interesting passage in the Ancient Laws
of Wales ordaining that the next-of-kin shall not inherit
as heir to his deceased kinsman, but as heir to the
ancestor, who, apart from himself, would be without
direct heir, <hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi> presumably their common ancestor.
</p>

<quote rend="display">
<q>No person is to obtain the land of a <emph>co-heir</emph>, as of a brother, or

</quote>

<p>
This of course refers to inheritance within the
group of co-heirs, the members of which held their
position by virtue of their common relationship within
certain degrees to the founder. And we may infer
that emphasis was thus laid on the proof of relationship
by <emph>direct descent</emph>, in order to prevent shares in
the inheritance passing from hand to hand unnoticed,

All are Sapindas who offer the cake to the same
ancestors.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">Four generations share in the cake-offering.</note>
The head of the family would himself offer or
share with all his descendants in the offering of the
one cake to his great-grandfather, his grandfather, and
his father. And if this passage is taken in conjunction
with the one quoted just above, the number
sharing in the cake-offering, limited as in the text at
the seventh person from the first ancestor who
receives the cake, is just sufficient to include the great-grandson
of the head of the family, supposed to be
making the offering.
</p>

<p>
The group, thus sharing the same cake-offering,
would in the natural course be moving continually
downwards, generation by generation as the head of
the family died, thereby causing the great-grandfather
to pass from the receivers of the cake-offering
to the receivers of the water libation, and admitting
the great-grandson's son into the number of Sapindas
who shared the cake-offering. And at no time would
more than four generations have a share in the same
cake offered to the three nearest ancestors of the head
of the family.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">Similar grouping of the pourers of the water libation.</note>
The Samānodakas, or pourers of the water libation
appear to have been similarly grouped.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ignorance of birth and name</q> was in Wales
considered to be equivalent to <emph>beyond fifth cousins</emph>.
According to the Gwentian Code, <q>there is no proper
name in kin further than that</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi> fifth
cousins.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Gwentian Code</hi>, ii. viii.</note>
And this tallies exactly with the previous
quotation from Manu limiting the water libation to
<pb n="054"/><anchor id="Pg054"/>
three generations of ancestors beyond those to whom
the cake is due, which, as has been seen, includes
fifth cousins.
</p>

<p>
And it must be borne in mind that fifth cousins
are great-grandsons of the great-grandsons of their
common ancestor, or two generations of groups of
second cousins.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">The οἶκος includes four generations.</note>
It was extremely improbable that a man would
see further than his great-grandchildren born to him
before his death. And it might also occasionally
occur in times of war or invasion that a man's sons
and grandsons might go out to serve as soldiers,
leaving the old man and his young great-grandchildren
at home.
</p>

<p>
If the fighting members of the family were
killed, the great-grandsons (who would be second
cousins or nearer to each other) would have to
inherit directly from their great-grandfather: and
thus, especially in cases where the property was held
undivided after the father's death, we can easily see
that second cousins (<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi> all who traced back to the
common great-grandfather) might be looked upon as
forming a natural limit to the immediate descendants
in any one οἶκος, and as the furthest removed who
could claim shares of the ancestral inheritance.
</p>

<p>
After the death of the great-grandfather or head
of the house, his descendants would probably wish
to divide up the estate and start new houses of their
own. The eldest son was generally named after his
father's father,<note place="foot">Dem. <hi rend='italic'>c. Makart.</hi> 1076.</note>
and would carry on the name of the
<pb n="055"/><anchor id="Pg055"/>
eldest branch of his great-grandfather's house, and
would be responsible for the proper maintenance of
the rites on that ancestor's tomb. He would also
be guardian of any brotherless woman or minor
amongst his cousins, each of whom would be equally
responsible to him and to each other for all the duties
and privileges entailed upon blood-relationship.
</p>

<p>
Thus seems naturally to spring up an inner
group of blood-relations closely drawn together by
ties which only indirectly reached other and outside
members of the γένος.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">The ἀγχιστεία at Athens.</note>
In the fourth century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> this compact group
limited to second cousins still survived at Athens,
responsible to each other for succession, by inheritance
or by marriage of a daughter; for vengeance
and purification after injury received by any member,
and for all duties shared by kindred blood.
</p>

<p>
This close relation was called ἀγχιστεία, and all
its members were called ἀγχιστεῖς <hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi> any one upon
whom the claim upon the next-of-kin might at any
time fall.
</p>

<p>
The speech of Demosthenes against Makartatos
affords considerable information as to the constitution
of the family-group or οἶκος. The five sons of
Bouselos,<note place="foot">Cf. <hi rend='italic'>infra</hi>, tree on p.
<ref target="Pg062">62</ref>.</note> we are told, on his death divided his substance
amongst them, and each started a new οἶκος

Makart.</hi> 1055-6.</note> The
action, which was the occasion of the speech, lay
between the great-grandsons of two of these five
founders of οἶκοι, Stratios and Hagnias, and had
reference to the disposal of the estate of the grandson
<pb n="056"/><anchor id="Pg056"/>
of the latter, which had come into the hands of
the great-grandson of Stratios.
</p>

<p>
One might have supposed that the descendants
of Bouselos, with their common burial ground<note place="foot">Dem.
<hi rend='italic'>c. Makart.</hi> 1077.</note> and
so forth, would have ranked as all in the same οἶκος
under their title of Bouselidai. But it is clear from
this speech of Demosthenes, that too many generations
had already passed to admit of Bouselos being
considered as still head of an unbroken οἶκος, and
that his <emph>great</emph>-great-grandsons were subdivided into
separate οἶκοι under the names of their respective

<head>§ 2. Limitations In Respect Of Succession
Outside The Direct Line Of Descent.</head>

<p>
<note place="margin">The right of succession limited to the great-grandchild of the
common ancestor.</note>
The Gortyn law quoted above in the previous
section goes on:&mdash;
</p>

<quote rend="display">
v. <q>If (a man or woman die and) they have no children, the
deceased's brothers and brother's children or <emph>grandchildren</emph> shall
have the property. If there are none of these, the deceased's sisters,
their children or <emph>grandchildren</emph>. If there are none of these, to
whom it descends of whatever grade they be, they shall inherit the
property.</q>
</quote>

<p>
This clause takes the evidence one step further,
and it is noticeable how the right of inheritance is
determined by the great-grandchild of the common
ancestor. In the direct line, a man's descendants
<pb n="057"/><anchor id="Pg057"/>
down to his great-grandchildren inherited his estate.
In dealing with inheritance through a brother of the
deceased the heirship terminates with the <emph>grandchild</emph>
of the brother, who would be great-grandchild of the
nearest common ancestor with the previous owner of
the estate. If there is no brother, the child of the
cousin limits the next branch, as will be seen.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">The law according to Isaeus.</note>
Isaeus<note place="foot">Isaeus,
vii. 22, and xi. i.</note> describes the working of the then-existing
(c. 350 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi>) law of inheritance at Athens as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The law gives <q>brothers' property</q> (i.e. property
without lineal succession) to
</p>

<quote rend="display">
1. <emph>Brothers</emph> by the same father, or brother's
children, for these are related to the deceased
in the nearest degree;
</quote>

<quote rend="display">
2. <emph>Sisters</emph> by the same father, or sister's children;
</quote>

<quote rend="display">
3. <emph>First cousins</emph> by the father's side as far as
<emph>cousin's children</emph> (δίδωσι τὴν ἀγχιστείαν
ἀνεψιοῖς πρὸς πατρὸς μέχρι <emph>ἀνεψιῶν παίδων</emph>).
</quote>

<quote rend="display">
Failing these, recourse is had back again into
the family (εἰς τὸ γένος πάλιν ἐπανέρχεται) and
the law makes those related through the <emph>mother</emph>
of the deceased, masters (κύριοι) of the family
(and inheritance) in the same order as on the
father's side from the beginning.
</quote>

<p>
That is to say, failing first cousins once removed, the
inheritance goes back and begins again at the mother
of the deceased, who however, being a woman, can only
inherit on behalf of her issue, present or prospective.<note place="foot">Isaeus,
xi. 30.</note> If she has married again and has a son (half-brother
to her deceased son) he would inherit. Failing her
issue, her brother and so on to first cousin's children

of the deceased, through his mother, would have the
inheritance.
</p>

<p>
Failing these, the nearest kinsman to be found
on the father's side, of whatsoever degree, is to
inherit.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">The law according to Demosthenes.</note>
The law as stated by Demosthenes<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>c. Makart.</hi>
1067.</note> coincides with this:&mdash;
</p>

<quote rend="display">
<q>If there are no sons, brothers by the same father (shall
inherit): and their true born children, if there are any, shall have
the share of their father: if there are no brothers or brother's
children the issue of the latter in the same way shall partake:
males and children of males shall have preference (over females) if
they are born of the same (parents), even if they are further off by
birth (γένει) [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi> are a generation lower down]. If there are none
on the father's side as far as <emph>cousin's children</emph> (μέχρι ἀνεψιῶν παίδων),
the relations on the mother's side in the same way shall have
possession (κυρίους εἶναι). But if there are none on either side
<emph>within these degrees</emph>, the nearest of kin on the father's side shall
have possession.</q>
</quote>

<p>
Whenever this law is quoted the limit of relationship
laid down therein for the immediate ἀγχιστεία is
always that of ἀνεψιῶν παῖδες, or sons of first cousins,
who inherit from their first cousins once removed
(<hi rend='italic'>oncle à la Brétagne</hi>, or Welsh uncle as this relation
has been called). Occasionally the patronymic form
ἀνεψιαδοῖ is used, apparently with the same signification,
though properly ἀνεψιαδοῖ would mean sons of
two first cousins, <hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi> second cousins.<note place="foot">In Dem.
<hi rend='italic'>c. Leochar.</hi> 1088. ἀνεψιαδοῦς is used to denote the
relationship of a man to the adopted son of his great-uncle, or, as
we should say, first cousin once removed.</note>
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">No ἀγχιστεία beyond great-grandsons.</note>
It appears from the evidence reviewed hitherto,
that any great-grandson could inherit from any
grandson of a common ancestor, and the conclusion
<pb n="059"/><anchor id="Pg059"/>
also seems to be justified, that the group of great-grandsons
were considered to divide up their right to
inherit once for all, and that having done so, with
respect to that inheritance they were considered to
have begun a new succession. To put it differently,
in case of the death of one of these second cousins,
after the final division of their inheritance had taken
place, the rest of the second cousins would have no
right to a share in his portion; an heir would
have to be found within his nearer relations. Thus,
they share responsibilities towards any of their
relations within the group and higher up in their
families, and also stand shoulder to shoulder in sharing
such burdens as pollution and so on, but are outside
the immediate ἀγχιστεία with respect to each
other's succession. The reason for this will perhaps
be more apparent as the argument proceeds.
</p>

<p>
That the grandson of a first cousin was outside
the ἀγχιστεία is clear from the speech of Demosthenes
already mentioned,<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>c. Makart.</hi> 1053.</note>
where the plaintiff, who originally
stands in that relationship to the deceased whose
inheritance is in dispute, is adopted as son of
his grandfather (first cousin of the deceased),
in order to come within the legal definition of
ἀνεψιοῦ παῖς.
</p>

<p>
That the son of a second cousin was also without
the pale is directly stated in several passages in
Isaeus.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">The heir always ranked as <emph>son</emph>.</note>
It must be remembered that by <q>inheritance</q> is
meant the assumption of all the duties incumbent on
the ἀγχιστεύς, and that the man who <q>inherited</q> took
<pb n="060"/><anchor id="Pg060"/>
his place for the future as son of the deceased in the
family pedigree, and reckoned his relationship to the
rest of the γένος thenceforth from his new position, in
the house into which he had come.<note place="foot">Dem. <hi rend='italic'>c.
Makart.</hi> and <hi rend='italic'>c. Leoch.</hi> 1100, &amp;c.</note>
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">Hence the limit of the inheritance at cousin's children.</note>
Now if it is true that to the great-grandson was
the lowest in degree to which property could directly
descend without entering a new οἶκος, and if that
great-grandson was also looked upon as beginning with
his acquired property a new portion of the continuous
line of descent; any one, who <q>inherited</q> from him
and ranked in the scale of relationship as <hi rend="smallcaps">HIS SON</hi>,
would necessarily fall outside the former group and
would be considered as forming the nearest relative
in the next succeeding group. This, it seems, is the
meaning of the language of the law which limits the
ἀγχιστεία to the children of first cousins who could
inherit from their parent's first cousins, and still
<emph>retain their relationship as great-grandsons</emph> of the
same ancestor. Whereas any one taking the place of
son to his second cousin would be one degree lower
down in descent, and pass outside the limit of the
four generations. The law makes the kinsmen therefore
exhaust all possible relationships <emph>within the
group</emph> by reverting to the mother's kindred with the
same limitation before allowing the inheritance to
pass outside or lower down.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">Disinheritance must be sanctioned by kinsmen.</note>
In confirmation of this view the following passage
may be quoted from <hi rend='italic'>Plato's Laws</hi>:&mdash;
</p>

<quote rend="display">
<q>He who in the sad disorder of his soul has a mind, justly or
unjustly, to expel from his family a son whom he has begotten and
brought up, shall not lightly or at once execute his purpose; but
<pb n="061"/><anchor id="Pg061"/>
first of all he shall collect together his own kinsmen, extending to
(<emph>first</emph>) <emph>cousins</emph> (μέχρι ἀνεψιῶν), and in
like manner his son's kinsmen by the mother's side,<note place="foot">The wife's
kin are no kin to her husband, but <emph>are</emph> to her son.</note>
and in their presence he shall accuse his son,
setting forth that he deserves at the hands of them all to be dismissed
from the family (γένος).</q><note place="foot">Plato, <hi rend='italic'>Laws</hi>,
929 c. Trans. Jowett.</note>
</quote>

<p>
Before dishonouring one of the family and so
bereaving it of a member owing duties which, by his
disinheritance, may fall into abeyance or be neglected,
the parent calls together all to whom his son might
perhaps ultimately become the only living representative
and heir, and who might at some future time
be dependent on him for the performance of ancestral
rites. That this was in Plato's mind when he wrote
is shown by the next sentence, in which he provides
for the possibility of some relation already having
need of the young man and being desirous to adopt
him as his son, in which case he shall by no means
be prevented. The concurrence of all relations in
such a position was therefore necessary.
</p>

<p>
In other cases where Plato mentions similar
gatherings of the kin but for different purposes, he
extends the summons to <emph>cousin's children</emph>. But here
it can be seen they would have no place. They would
be second cousins to the disgraced youth; they might
have to share privilege or pollution with him, but
had no claim on him for duties towards themselves.
He would be <q>cousin's son</q> to his father's first
cousins&mdash;the limit of such a claim in the ἀγχιστεία.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">The case of the estate of Hagnias in Isaeus and
Demosthenes.</note>
In the speech of Isaeus concerning the estate
of Hagnias, a real second cousin is in possession of
the estate. He won the case at the time and died in
<pb n="062"/><anchor id="Pg062"/>
possession, and an action against his son Makartatos
for the same property is the occasion of one of the
speeches of Demosthenes. To fully understand the
relationships referred to in these cases, the accompanying
genealogical tree of the descendants of
Bouselos may be of assistance. It will also serve as
an example of how a kindred hung together, and how
by intermarriage and adoption the name of the head

descendants.

<p>
Theopompos, in the speech of Isaeus, had taken
possession of the estate of his second cousin Hagnias,
as his next of kin and heir. Throughout the speech
he is styled ἀνεψιοῦ παῖς so as to bring him
within the phraseology of the law, and he successfully
defends himself from the claims of the next
generation below&mdash;viz., his brother's son. But in the
speech of Demosthenes against his son Makartatos,
who had taken possession at his father's death of the
disputed property, it is represented that his father
had got possession only by defeating another
claimant, Phylomache II., by <q>surprise,</q> as it was
called, by stating that her grandmother through
whom she traced her claim was only half-sister to
Hagnias' father. But Phylomache's husband, having
caused their son Euboulides III. to be adopted as the
son of Euboulides II.&mdash;his wife's father and Hagnias'
first cousin, a quite regular course for the grandson
inheriting through his heiress mother&mdash;proved that
his wife's grandmother was whole sister to Hagnias
father, and brought the action under the guidance of
Demosthenes against Makartatos. This Euboulides
III. sued as true ἀνεψιοῦ παῖς and οἰκεῖος ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου
<pb n="064"/><anchor id="Pg064"/>
of Hagnias.<note place="foot">Dem. <hi rend='italic'>c. Makart.</hi> 1058.</note>
He is described as having <q>one of the
titles mentioned in the law <emph>as far as which</emph> the law
bids the ἀγχιστεία go, for he is <emph>cousin's son</emph> to
Hagnias.</q>
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, Theopompos, father of Makartatos
and second cousin of Hagnias, is
mentioned<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Id.</hi> 1070.</note>
as <q>being of a different οἶκος altogether,</q> and
not at all related in such a way as to be heir of
Hagnias (μηδὲν προσηκόντων ὤστε κληρονομεῖν τῶν
Ἁγνίου, ἀλλὰ γένει <emph>ἀπωτέρω</emph> ὄντων), being too far off
in the family (or by birth).
</p>

<p>
That the title of Theopompos (viz., second cousinship)
was not valid, may be inferred partly by the
ruses he adopted to get possession, but more especially
by the fact<note place="foot">Mentioned in Dem. <hi rend='italic'>c. Makart.</hi>
1056.</note> that none of the other second cousins on
a par with him, and with whom he ought to have
shared, seem to have believed in the validity of
their titles, or at any rate taken the trouble to sue for
part of the estate.
</p>

<p>
However this may be, there does not seem anything
in these speeches other than confirmatory of
the view stated above of the composition and
limitation of the ἀγχιστεία.

<head>§ 3. Division Amongst Heirs.</head>

<p>
<note place="margin">Equal division amongst heirs of the same grade.</note>
Succession to the inheritance of an estate was
ordained by law in strict accordance with the ancient
conception of the unity of the family. On the death
of the head of a family, unless the paternal οἶκος was
<pb n="065"/><anchor id="Pg065"/>
voluntarily continued unbroken by his descendants,
the natural course was for each son ultimately to live
apart and found a separate οἶκος consisting of himself
and his offspring. Equal division amongst heirs was
therefore the rule in Greece; equal division, that is to
say, between all of equal grade.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">The share of a dead son taken by his children.</note>
The Gortyn Laws have already been referred to
as enforcing the principle.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Supra</hi>, p.
<ref target="Pg056">56</ref>.</note> If a man died, his heirs
were either his sons, or his grandsons, or his greatgrandsons.
If he had no children, his brothers, and
their children, or their grandchildren succeeded.
</p>

<p>
The Athenian law was conceived in the same
spirit, but mentions a further point&mdash;viz., that in the
division amongst sons, the οἶκος of any one of their
number who had died before the division, could be
represented by his sons or grandsons, who thus
received their father's share.
</p>

<p>
This system of representation probably existed
also among the Gortynians, though no mention of it
is made in their laws, for it is inconceivable that any
of the grandsons could be deprived of all share in
their grandfather's estate by the mere death of the
intermediate generation.
</p>

<p>
But the division <hi rend='italic'>per stirpes</hi> was not maintained
throughout. It is probable from the words of the
Attic orators that equal division amongst all of the
same grade, such as nephews or cousins, took place
<hi rend='italic'>per capita</hi>, any deceased member of that grade being
represented by his sons. Representation, of course,
could not take place in the case of a division amongst
cousins' sons, owing to the strict limitation of the
<pb n="066"/><anchor id="Pg066"/>
ἀγχιστεία to four generations from the common ancestor;
any deceased relation in that degree therefore
simply dropped out of the succession.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">If sons all dead, grandsons probably divided
<hi rend='italic'>per capita</hi>,</note>
It has generally been assumed that grandsons
inheriting directly from their grandfather, all the
intermediate generation being already dead, inherited
none the less the shares of their respective fathers
<hi rend='italic'>per stirpes</hi>. But if the foregoing account of the
unity of the οἶκος and its resemblance in its composition
to the household of the Welsh tribal system be
correct, it seems more reasonable to suppose that, all
the intermediate generation being dead, the grandsons,
in virtue of being all equally related to their
grandfather, would inherit in equal shares <hi rend='italic'>per capita</hi>.
Any dead grandson would of course be represented,
as before, by his son or sons.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">as in the case of nephews and cousins.</note>
The evidence is not sufficient to justify more than
a suggestion on either side with regard to divisions
amongst lineal descendants. With regard to successions
by relations outside of the direct line of
descent, such as nephews or cousins, it is almost
certain that all of the same degree took equal shares
<hi rend='italic'>per capita</hi>.
</p>

<p>
Following the law for daughters, quoted by
Demosthenes<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>c. Makart.</hi> 1068,
<hi rend='italic'>supra</hi>, p. 26.</note>&mdash;viz., that though all shared the
inheritance of the property, only one need be dealt with
in view of securing the succession&mdash;the assumption can
be made that, when there were several heirs related
in the same degree to the former owner of the estate,
one of their number would be set apart to continue
the household of their kinsman as his son, whilst the
<pb n="067"/><anchor id="Pg067"/>
others merely took their shares of the property
divided to continue their own οἶκοι respectively.
</p>

<p>
The equal division of inheritance amongst kinsmen
of equal degree <hi rend='italic'>per capita</hi>, in combination with the
system of representation above described, is entirely
consistent with the tribal conception of the household
as hanging closely together, its members always
looking up to their venerable head, in whom the

<head>§ 4. Qualifications For The Recognition Of Tribal Blood.</head>

<p>
<note place="margin">Purity of tribal blood jealously guarded.</note>
It has been remarked above with what jealousy
the purity of the blood of the community was
guarded. No child was admitted into the kindred of
its father until all concerned were fully convinced of
the blamelessness of its pedigree. In such circumstances
it was no easy matter to acquire the privileges
attached to the possession of tribal or citizen
blood. It seems to have been considered that however
great otherwise the claims of a stranger might
be, time alone could really render the qualifications
of his family complete.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">In Wales, privileges attained in the fourth
generation by intermarriages.</note>
Under the ancient Laws of Wales no stranger's
family could acquire the full privileges of a Welsh
tribesman or Cymro, as regards location on land,
until after many generations. But if they married
Welshwomen, and held land from generation to generation,
<pb n="068"/><anchor id="Pg068"/>
the <emph>greatgrandsons</emph> became fully privileged
tribesmen.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Welsh Laws</hi>, iv. i. and x.
vii. Exception is made for the <emph>son of a stranger chieftain</emph>.</note>
Similarly if a stranger voluntarily
assumed the position of serf to a Welshman, and his
descendants did not choose to depart, but remained in
that position to the descendants of the Welshman,
the <emph>greatgrandsons</emph> of the Welshman became proprietors
of the greatgrandsons of the stranger.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Welsh
Laws</hi>, v. ii. and <hi rend='italic'>Vened. Code</hi>, ii. xvi. and elsewhere.</note>
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">Otherwise not until the tenth generation.</note>
But for the stranger who merely resided in Wales
and did not marry into any Welsh tribe the period
of probation was <emph>three times as long</emph>&mdash;viz., the greatgrandson
of the greatgrandson of his greatgrandson
was the first to attain to full tribal privilege&mdash;
</p>

<quote rend="display">
<q>Strangers and their progeny are adjudged to be aillts; also a

<p>

But the aillt or stranger, who dwells
in Cymru, does not attain until the <emph>end of the ninth
descent</emph>.
</p>

<p>
So too inversely:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The title to inherit by kin and descent in the
tribal land and rights of his ancestors does not become
extinct <emph>till the ninth man</emph>. The ninth man in descent
from a banished tribesman coming home and finding
his title as representative of his family seemingly
<pb n="069"/><anchor id="Pg069"/>
extinguished, is to raise an outcry that from a
proprietor he is becoming a nonproprietor, and the
law will shelter him and adjudge him an equal
share with the occupants he finds on the land.
This is called the <q>outcry across the abyss.</q> The
tenth man's outcry cannot be heard. <q>Others say</q>
that the ninth man is too late to raise the
cry.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Venedotian Code</hi>, ii. xiv. and

Shunammite's <hi rend='italic'>cry unto the King</hi>
for restoration of her house and fields after an absence of seven
years. 2 Kings viii. 3.</note>
</p>

<p>
This is exactly parallel to the case of the stranger
resident in Cymru. For <emph>nine</emph> generations he is a
stranger, and in <emph>the tenth</emph> a Cymro. Here for <emph>nine</emph>
generations is the Cymro abroad a tribesman, and
in <emph>the tenth</emph> he is a stranger.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">The same rule amongst the Israelites.</note>
From a passage in Deuteronomy it would appear
that the qualifications for admission as a full tribesman
amongst the Israelites were identical with those
just mentioned.
</p>

<p>
The Israelites had purified themselves of the ancestor
worship, that so long survived in Greece, and
had, if one may say so, amalgamated all their minor
deities and tribal superstitions in their one great monotheistic
religion. Even then their tribal minds could
not carry back their theology behind the known history
of their own ancestors. Their God was the God of
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and was in their conception
the greatest of Gods&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, greater than the
Gods of other peoples, the existence of which their
own beliefs did not preclude. Thus where in Attic
writers we have mention of the religious rites of the
family (which a stranger or polluted man might not
<pb n="070"/><anchor id="Pg070"/>
approach), and of the partaking therein as proof of
the whole admission and pure blood of those present,
so in Deuteronomy the expression <q>the Congregation
of the Lord,</q> is used to denote that sacred
precinct, forbidden to all save pure tribesmen of Israel.
</p>

<p>
It may be inferred from the following passage
that if a stranger resided in Israel, and his family
continued to do so for nine generations, the tenth
generation would in any ordinary case be admitted
to the Congregation of the Lord as full Israelites.
</p>

<quote rend="display">
Deut. xxiii. 2 and 3. <q>A bastard, or an Ammonite, or Moabite
shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord <emph>even to their tenth
generation</emph>, for ever.</q>
</quote>

<p>
<note place="margin">Shorter time in special cases.</note>
In special cases (exactly as was the rule in
Wales)&mdash;such as the Edomite who was partly akin
already, and the Egyptian who was united to the
Israelites by the mysterious bonds of hospitality&mdash;a
shorter sojourn in the land was held to qualify for full
tribal privilege.
</p>

<quote rend="display">
Deut. xxiii. 7 and 8. <q>Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite, for
he is thy brother: thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian, because thou
wast a stranger in his land. The <emph>children</emph> that are begotten of
them shall enter into the congregation of the Lord <emph>in their third
generation</emph>.</q>
</quote>

<p>
The third generation of <emph>children</emph> would be the
<emph>greatgrandchildren</emph> of the original settler, and this
is just one third of the length of time implied as
required from the ordinary stranger, who only
attained the tribal privilege in the third succession
of greatgrandchildren.
</p>

<p>
It is worth notice in this connection that the land
of Canaan was divided up in the names of the <emph>greatgrandchildren</emph>
of Abraham, to whom the promise was
<pb n="071"/><anchor id="Pg071"/>
made; Ephraim and Manasseh, the sons of Joseph,
taking their place amongst the others by adoption as
sons by their grandfather Jacob, on an equality with
his other sons.<note place="foot">Gen. xlviii. 5. <hi rend='italic'>Cf.</hi> Pindar,

<note place="margin">The privilege of citizenship jealously guarded at
Athens.</note>
These rules are not to be found with the same
distinctness surviving at Athens, but there is a good
deal of evidence showing how jealously the introduction
of strangers to citizenship&mdash;which retained much
that made it the later equivalent of the tribal bond&mdash;was
regarded.
</p>

<p>
Strangers made citizens (formally, ceremoniously,
and by public vote) by the Athenian people cannot
hold office as archon or partake of a holy office
(ἱεροσύνη); but their <emph>children can</emph>, if they are born
from a citizen wife duly and lawfully betrothed.<note place="foot">Dem.
<hi rend='italic'>in Neaer.</hi> 1376.</note>
That is to say, that the Athenians considered it necessary
that there should be actually citizen blood in
the veins of all who held office amongst them.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Anc.
Inscrip.</hi> Brit. Mus. ccxxxviii. Citizenship had to be
confirmed on son of foreigner admitted to citizenship.</note>
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">Abhorrence of alien blood.</note>
The abhorrence in which the introduction of alien
blood was held is illustrated by the Athenian law
concerning marriage with aliens, quoted by Demosthenes
in his speech against Neaera.
</p>

<quote rend="display">
<hi rend='italic'>Law</hi>: <q>If an alien shall live as husband with an Athenian
woman by any device or contrivance whatever, it shall be lawful
for any of the Athenians who are possessed of such right, to indict
him before the judges. And if he is convicted, he shall be sold for
a slave and his property confiscated, and the third part shall belong
<pb n="072"/><anchor id="Pg072"/>
to the person who has convicted him. And the like proceedings
shall be taken if an alien woman live as wife with an Athenian
citizen, and the citizen who lives as husband with an alien woman
so convicted shall incur the penalty of 1,000 drachmæ.</q>
</quote>

<p>
<note place="margin">Citizenship only conferred as the highest honour.</note>
Citizenship was considered the highest of privileges,
and was conferred only on persons worthy of
great honour. Any citizen could bring an action
against the newly-admitted stranger to test his real
merits, and even after formal acceptance by the
people of Athens, if he failed to justify his claims at
such a trial, his new honours were stripped from him
and he remained an alien. This being so, it cannot
be expected in the comparison that he should rank
with the ordinary resident in Cymru in the Welsh
Laws, but rather as the chieftain whom the
people wished to honour by admission to their
tribe.
</p>

<p>
It is stated in the Welsh Laws that the <emph>son</emph> of a
stranger chief, to whom honour was to be given,
entered the whole privilege of the tribe.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">Qualification dependent on ancestry and
status of family.</note>
According to Aristotle,<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Ath. Pol.</hi> lv. 3.</note>
candidates for archonship at Athens were asked their father's name and his
deme, their grandfather's name and his deme, their
mother's and her father's name and his
deme;<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Cf.</hi> Pollux, viii. 85: εἰ
Ἀθηναῖοί εἰσιν ἑκατερωθεν ἐκ τριγονίας.</note>
whether the candidate had an Apollo Patroïos and
Zeus Herkeios, and where these shrines were:
also if he treated his parents well and paid his
taxes.
</p>

<p>
In order to be perfectly sure that the candidate
was of full and pure blood, they investigated the condition
of both his grandparents, and, as further proof,
<pb n="073"/><anchor id="Pg073"/>
assured themselves that he had a house and property
of his own, and that too inherited from his ancestors.
Furthermore, he must be guilty of no impiety towards
his parents or the State.
</p>

<p>
If it were the case at Athens that the fourth
generation from a stranger was considered as having
attained to the rights of a citizen, it mattered little
what a man's <emph>greatgrand</emph>father was. He might have
been an alien, yet if the intermediate ancestors were
<q>in order,</q> the candidate would have acquired the full
blood.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Cf.</hi> Aristot. <hi rend='italic'>Pol.</hi>

In elections for sacred offices, which appear to
have been about the last things laid open to the new
citizen, the possession of three generations of privileged
ancestors was in some places insisted on.

It was no doubt a wise policy on the part of the
legislators, with the view to the preservation of respect
for life and property, to make the responsibility for
murder rest as widely as possible, and include as
many relations and connections on both sides as might
be. In order also that the wife, in case her husband
was killed, and the daughter, in case her father was
killed, might be fully protected and represented
<pb n="076"/><anchor id="Pg076"/>
among the prosecuting kindred, the law of Draco
seems to lay the necessity for action also on the
father-in-law and the son-in-law. The <hi rend='italic'>phratria</hi>, being
such a compact organisation and exacting such
formal admission of its members, would naturally be
concerned to see that justice was dealt to any of its

amongst those directly responsible equally with the
near kinsmen for crimes committed by one of their

<p>
<q>The law commands the relations to go forth and

In the ancient Laws of Wales the blood-fine takes

inner kindred within fixed degrees contribute proportionally

in the Welsh Laws as at Athens, and includes <emph>fifth</emph>
cousins, or the greatgrandchildren of greatgrandchildren
of a common ancestor.

The payment of the blood-fine by the whole
family of the murderer was considered necessary to
<pb n="080"/><anchor id="Pg080"/>
allay the vengeance and anger of the family of the
murdered man within the same area of relationship.
In Wales the members of the family who received
the galanas, did so in proportion to the importance
of their position in the transmission of the kindred
blood, according to a classification identical with
their proximity in relationship to the dead man,
and their expectation of inheritance from him or succession
to his place.

<p>
<note place="margin">The mother's relations included in Greece
and in Wales.</note>
The inclusion of the mother's relatives and their
liability in these circumstances, in addition to the
paternal relations, follow naturally enough in Wales
as in Greece when once the transmission of inheritance
through a woman, in default of male heirs, had
become a recognised possibility. A woman's sons
might always be called upon under certain circumstances
to take inheritance from <emph>her</emph> father or next of
kin. They therefore quite fairly shared in the claims
as well as the privileges of their position. And <hi rend='italic'>vice
versa</hi>, in exchange for the priceless guarantee of continuity
provided by a woman's offspring to her relations,
they too would be prepared to undergo a part
of the penalties incurred by any of those who might
rank some day as their next of kin, or as their
sons.
</p>

<p>
This view of the source of their recognition as
members of the kindred responsible for the blood-fine
in Wales is confirmed by a statement in the Venedotian
Code.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Welsh Laws</hi>, vol. i. 229. Cf.
<hi rend='italic'>Ord. of Manu</hi>, ix. 201, where list
of those incapable of receiving inheritance includes eunuchs.</note>
Those women and clerks who can
swear that they will never have children, and so
are useless for the preservation of continuity in the
<pb n="081"/><anchor id="Pg081"/>
families to which they belong, are specially exempted
from contribution to the galanas, inasmuch as they
have forsworn the privilege of attaining through posterity
a share in the immortality on earth of their
kindred.

<head>§ 1. The Κλῆρος And Its Form.</head>

<p>
In trying to realise the methods of land tenure
amongst the Greeks, we are baffled by the indirectness
of the evidence available.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">The usual holding of a citizen was called
a κλῆρος or <q>lot.</q></note>
We know that the estate which descended from
father to son, and was in theory inalienable from the
family of its original possessors, was called a κλῆρος
or <q>lot,</q> but the familiarity with which the poets,
historians, and orators use the word does not afford
information as to what the κλῆρος really was and how
it was made use of in practice. The law concerning
these family holdings, says Aristotle,<note place="foot">ὁ περὶ τῶν κλήρων καὶ
ἐπικλήρων. <hi rend='italic'>Pol. Ath.</hi> 9.</note> and concerning
their possible transmission through daughters was
not written. It was a typical example of customary
law. This statement gives a hint as to the usual
treatment of questions arising under this head.
Methods of land tenure were not of rapid growth, nor
<pb n="083"/><anchor id="Pg083"/>
were they easily changed; they had their source with
the slow devotion to agriculture of pastoral tribes,
and were dependent on a class unaffected by the
growth of education and the arts.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">The relation of ownership of land to the structure of
the family.</note>
The intricate connection of the system of land
tenure with the composition of the family removed
the consideration of questions of ownership from the
sphere of written law, and delegated them to the most
conservative department of customary procedure,
ranking them on a par with questions of family
religious observances.<note place="foot">Cf. <hi rend='italic'>Cic. de Legibus</hi>
ii. 21. Nam sacra cum pecunia pontificum
auctoritate, nulla lege conjuncta sunt.</note> The deposit of some ancestor's
bones in a certain field was occasionally a valuable
link in the title to possession of that piece of land as
private property;<note place="foot">Dem. <hi rend='italic'>in Calliclem</hi>, 13-14.
Coulanges, <hi rend='italic'>Problèmes d'Histoire</hi>,
p. 19.</note> and the possession of land at all
was in part a guarantee of the pure native blood in
the veins of the possessor.<note place="foot">Arist. <hi rend='italic'>Pol. Ath.</hi>
lv. 3; Harpocration, ὅτι δὲ τούτοις μετῆν τῆς πολιτείας οἷς εἴη Ζεὺς ἑρκεῖος,
δεδήλωκε καὶ Ὑπερείδης ...</note> It is a striking illustration
of the truth of this that, throughout all the extant
speeches of Isaeus dealing with the disposal of κλῆροι
of dead citizens, not a single case turns upon evidence
for or against a sale or transfer of property. The
speeches all deal exclusively with family matters;
the line of argument always leads to the proof of near
kinship by blood or adoption to the previous owner;
and the right of possession of the inheritance seems
taken for granted as following incontrovertibly the
establishment of the required relationship.<note place="foot">In other words, the devisee
could not possess the property devised to him until his place as
heir in the succession by blood or adoption was legally established.</note>
</p>

<pb n="084"/><anchor id="Pg084"/>

<quote rend="display">
<q>It seems to me that all those who contend for the right of
succession to estates, when like us they have shown themselves to
be both nearest in blood to the person deceased, and most connected
with him in friendship (φιλίᾳ), are dispensed from adding
a superfluity of other arguments.</q><note place="foot">Isaeus, i. 17. The
<q>friendship</q> insured that his presence
and officiating at the tomb would be acceptable to the soul of the
deceased&mdash;always an important consideration.</note>

<p>
<note place="margin">Early semi-pastoral habits.</note>
In the early settlements, as Thucydides tells us,
necessity was the ruling motive. Each man devoted
his attention to providing the necessaries of life.
There was superfluity neither of chattels nor of tilth.
Men hesitate to sow when the harvest is to be reaped
by their enemies.<note place="foot">Thuc. i. 2. Νεμόμενοί τε τὰ αὑτῶν ἔκαστοι ὅσον
ἀποζῇν, καὶ περιουσίαν χρημάτων οὐκ ἔχοντες οὐδὲ γῆν φυτεύοντες, ἄδηλον ὃν
ὁπότε τις ἐπελθὼν καὶ ἀτειχίστων ἅμα ὄντων ἄλλος ἀφαιρήσεται.</note>
The flocks and herds of the
pastoral tribes could be driven for safety into the
mountain strongholds; yet even they were liable to
frequent losses. On one occasion Odysseus had to
go to Messene <q>to recover a debt; which, to wit, the
whole people owed him (πᾶς δῆμος): for the Messenians
had lifted 300 sheep with their shepherds
from Ithaka.</q><note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Od.</hi> 21. 16. Cf.
<hi rend='italic'>Il.</hi> xi. 682 <hi rend='italic'>sq.</hi> where the booty consists of
50 herds of kine, 50 flocks of sheep, 50 droves of swine, 50
flocks of goats, and 150 chestnut mares, many with foals at foot.</note>
As the newcomers increased in numbers
and gained a reputation for ability to defend
their own, sufficient to discourage the attacks of their
neighbours, they would have leisure to devote some
of their energies to the cultivation of the plains
around them. Troy was founded first up in the
hills,<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Il.</hi> xx. 216-8.</note>
and afterwards was moved down to a good position on
the lower ground for the sake no doubt of the better
<pb n="085"/><anchor id="Pg085"/>
pasture in the river meadows, and of the agriculture
which had long been carried on over the <q>wheat-bearing
plain</q> around the city,<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Il.</hi> xxi. 602.
Cf. <hi rend='italic'>Od.</hi> iii. 495.</note> before the ravages of
the ten years' war.
</p>

<p>
It is not proposed to enter in detail into the
<emph>methods</emph> of cultivation of the soil in vogue at various
times in Greece; but inasmuch as whilst studying
the kernel, assistance may often be obtained from
knowledge of the shell, mention may be made in
passing of such few points of interest in the physical
features of agriculture as may be available.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">Modern methods of land-tenure in Greece
and the islands.</note>
In the Consular Reports on Land Tenure in Europe
made in 1869, descriptions are given of the existing
methods of tenure and cultivation in Greece and the
Islands.
</p>

<p>
In Greece the usual holding of a small proprietor
is said to be of fifteen to twenty-five acres (or sometimes
double that area), and is called a
<hi rend='italic'>zeugarion</hi>.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Consular
Reports</hi>, p. 20.</note>
Many have only a couple of acres.
</p>

<quote rend="display">
<q>The greatest inconvenience and frequent lawsuits arise from
the manner in which these properties intersect each other. Moreover
none of the usual precautions are adopted to mark the limits
of the different properties, which, in the absence of any reliable
land survey, are often very vaguely described in the title
deeds.</q><note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Ibid.</hi></note>
</quote>

<p>
In cases of intestacy real property is divided
equally among the children or nearest relatives.
When there is a will the testator can only reserve for
his disposal a share of the estate equivalent to that
which, after an equal division, descends by right to
each of the direct heirs.

<p>
<note place="margin">Family-holdings in Santa Maura.</note>
Professor Ansted, in his book on the Ionian
Islands in the year 1863, thus describes the management
of an estate on the Island of Santa Maura:&mdash;<note place="foot">P. 199.</note>
</p>

<quote rend="display">
<q>According to Ionian law, all the members of a family share
equally in the family property after the death of the father; but
it does not follow as a matter of course that the property is divided.
It is much more usual that the brothers and sisters, if young,
continue to live together till they either marry or undertake some
employment or business at a distance. If a sister marries, she is
dowered with a sum equivalent to her share. If a brother however
earns a separate income, from whatever source, whether he be
married or remain single, and whether he live in the same or a
different house, or even remove to another town or island, he pays
in all his income to a joint fund, <emph>the foundation of which is the
income obtained from the paternal estate</emph>. Those who do nothing
else manage the estate. One brother, perhaps, remains in the
village as cultivator, another lives in the town acting as factor, or
merchant to the estate, receiving and selling the produce and
managing the proceeds, whatever the case may be; and in addition
selling, exporting, and otherwise conducting a general business in
the same department. A third may perhaps receive and sell the
goods in a foreign country. A fourth may be a member of the
legislature, and a fifth a judge. Some marry and have families,
others remain single: but the incomes of all are united, each
draws out a reasonable share, according to his needs, and a very
close account is kept of all transactions. If one brother dies, his
children come into the partnership; and as time goes on, these
again will grow up and marry, the daughters receiving a proportional
and often large dower out of the joint fund, entirely without
reference to the special property of their parents. This may go on
indefinitely: but as family quarrels will arise, <emph>there are always
means of terminating the arrangement</emph>, and closing accounts, either
entirely as regards all, or partially as with reference to a <hi rend='italic'>mauvais
sujet</hi>, or troublesome member of the partnership.... This curious
patriarchal system, though obtaining more perfectly and frequently
in Santa Maura than in the other islands, exists in Cephalonia and
is said to be not quite unknown in Zante, where the state of
society approximates far more to that common in the western
countries of Europe. Santa Maura, being the most isolated of
all the islands and that which retains all ancient customs most
<pb n="087"/><anchor id="Pg087"/>
tenaciously, is naturally that in which this sort of communism can
exist with smallest risk of interference.</q>
</quote>

<p>
According to the Consular Reports, the relations
between landlord and tenant are governed more by
local usage than by law, and the landlord generally
takes on an average about 15 per cent. of the produce
in kind on the threshing-floor, as rent, in cases where
he does not supply more than the bare use of the
land.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Consular Reports</hi>, pp. 23 and
30.</note>
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">The open field system in Greece,</note>
There is little manuring; the light plough barely
turns the surface of the land. Land is usually allowed
to lie fallow every other year, sometimes two years
out of three. Sheep and goats are the chief stock;
they of course graze in summer on the mountains;
villages sometimes own forests and waste lands in
common.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">and in the islands.</note>
In the islands of the Archipelago,<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Ibid.</hi> p.

frequently divided into separate plots consisting of a
quarter or half acre apiece or even less, intersected by
those belonging to other parties. Cattle are pastured
on the fallow, roadsides, &amp;c., near the village.
</p>

<p>
In Cephalonia,<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Ibid.</hi> p. 40.</note>
holdings consist of from five to
twenty-five acres, seldom in a continuous piece, but
<q>cut up into patches and intersected by other properties.</q>
</p>

<p>
In Corfu,<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Ibid.</hi> p. 49.</note>
the holdings are similar&mdash;infinitesimally
small and intermixed pieces of land, especially in the
olive groves, where however there are no divisions
on the land and the <q>oldest inhabitant</q> has to be
asked for evidence of ownership in disputed cases.
</p>

<pb n="088"/><anchor id="Pg088"/>

<p>
Throughout the Greek nation, the peasants live in
their houses in villages and not on separate estates.
They help one another to avoid the expense of hired
labour, and themselves work for hire on the estates
of the large proprietors.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">The open field system in Homer.</note>

and indeed the division of the land tilled
by occupants of villages into small pieces or strips, in
such a way that the holding of each consists of a
number of isolated pieces lying promiscuously
amongst the strips of others, over the whole area
under plough, is a world-wide custom and is the habit
alike of the east as of the west.
</p>

<p>
Though the assertion cannot yet be made that
the κλῆρος was thus arranged on the soil, it can do
no harm at any rate to bear in mind this ancient and
still used method of dividing land, whilst considering
the question of the relation of the ownership of the
soil to the rank and status of the tribesman.

<head>§ 2. The Relation Of The Κλῆρος To The Οἶκος.</head>

<p>
<note place="margin">Ownership of the κλῆρος vested in the head of the οἶκος.</note>
The connection of the possession of land with the
headship of the family finds its counterpart in the
right of maintenance of those who had the true blood
of that family. And in those countries where the
sons remained until their father's death under his
<hi rend='italic'>patria potestas</hi> they had to look to him for maintenance
<pb n="089"/><anchor id="Pg089"/>
derived from the κλῆρος which descended to
him as the means of sustenance for himself and his
family. Where the head of the family alone was
responsible for the rites to the dead at the family
altars, the position of a son would always be incomplete
if he tried to establish during his father's lifetime
a hearth and household of his own. And it has
been already mentioned that it was necessary to
emancipate a son from the family of his own father,
before he could take property, passing on the death
of his mother's relations to her issue, and assume his
rightful position as their representative and the living
head of their household.<note place="foot">Isaeus, xi. 49 (Hagnias).</note>
</p>

<p>
According to Harpocration, the initiation into the
mysteries of the hearth only took place on the actual
assumption of the inheritance.<note place="foot">Harp. <hi rend='italic'>s. v.</hi>
ἀφ᾽ Ἑστίας μυεῖσθαι; Ἰσαῖος ἐν τῷ πρὸς Καλυδῶνα. ὁ ἀφ᾽ Ἑστίας μυούμενος
Ἀθηναῖος ἦν πάντως. κλήρῳ δὲ λαχὼν ἐμυεῖτο.</note>
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">Dependence of other members of the οἶκος.</note>
Occasionally a father feeling the weight of years
would be glad to pass on to his son during his lifetime
some of his burden of responsibility by making
him master of his estate (κύριος τῆς οὐσίας).<note place="foot">Isaeus, vii. 15 and 27,
(Apollod.)</note> In
this case, the son would be responsible for the
maintenance of his parent, a duty much insisted on
by Plato and Isaeus. In fact the conclusion is justified
that the family, until final subdivision into
separate οἶκοι, drew its supplies from the common
inheritance, and that the subdivision of the means of
subsistence was contemporaneous and co-extensive
with the differentiation of the various branches of the
original οἶκος along the lines of the rising generations.
</p>

<pb n="090"/><anchor id="Pg090"/>

<p>
The same may be inferred from the words of
Demosthenes describing the division of the property
of Bouselos amongst his sons and the foundation of
their several οἶκοι.
</p>

<quote rend="display">
<q>And all these sons of Bouselos became men, and their father
divided his substance amongst them all, with perfect justice. And
they having shared the substance, each of them married a wife
according to your laws, and there were born children to them all,
and children's children, and there grew up five οἶκοι from the one
οἶκος of Bouselos, and each dwelt apart, having his own house and
his own offspring.</q><note place="foot">1055 <hi rend='italic'>et seq.</hi>
<hi rend='italic'>Cf.</hi> 1149 where one brother lives with his father
after the division, whilst his brother has a house of his own:
and 1086 where two brothers live apart but with undivided estate.</note>
</quote>

<p>
In the meanwhile, before division, all sons had
equal right to participate in the family goods after the
father's death, and dowries had to be paid therefrom
to the daughters. The eldest brother was guardian
(κύριος) of his sisters and those of his brothers who
were minors, inasmuch as he succeeded to his father's
position of head of his kindred at the altars of their
ancestors. But in Greece at any rate his authority
over his brothers when once a division had taken
place seems to have been slight if it existed at all.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">The prerogative of the eldest brother,</note>
Amongst the Gods, the three brothers Zeus,
Poseidon, and Hades, sons of Rhea, shared their
inheritance from their father Kronos. They divided
everything in three, shaking lots thereover (παλλομένων).
Each took equal share of honour (ἔμμορε τιμῆς),
but earth and Olympos were common (ξυνή) to
all.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Il.</hi> xv. 187
<hi rend='italic'>sq.</hi></note>
But Zeus was the first-born and <q>knew more things</q>&mdash;Ἀλλὰ

Poseidon therefore avoided open strife with him, however
<pb n="091"/><anchor id="Pg091"/>
unwillingly. Though Zeus be the stronger,
grumbles the Sea-god, let him keep to his third share
and not interfere with his brothers' pleasure on their
common ground, the earth. Let him threaten his sons
and daughters who needs <emph>must</emph> listen to him (ἀκούσονται
καὶ ἀνάγκῃ). Yet because the Erinnyes ever take the
side of the eldest born&mdash;ὡς πρεσβυτέροισιν Ἐριννύες
αἰὲν ἕπονται&mdash;it were good counsel to knock under,
even though the division was made in perfect equality
(ἰσόμορον καὶ ὁμῇ πεπρωμένον αἴσῃ).<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Cf.</hi>

<note place="margin">contrasted with the power of the head of the household.</note>
This passage contrasts the recognised autocracy of
the head of the family over his own household with
the courteous deference of the younger brothers
towards the eldest; and it is evidence, so far as it
goes, that the eldest brother did not succeed to his
father's power over his grown-up brothers, but owed
what influence he did not obtain from the superior
advantages of his age and experience, to a superstitious
feeling that something was due to him in his position

<note place="margin">No joint holding between a father and his sons.</note>
But it must be borne in mind that though the

and was supposed to be inalienable therefrom,
there is no reason to suppose that there existed among

the Greeks a system of joint holding between father
and son. The ownership and management of the
property vested in the head of the family. It is true
that brothers did not always divide their inheritance
on the death of their father, but their undivided right
to their respective equal shares remained to each one
and his descendants as an individual property, and they

<note place="margin">Confirmatory evidence of the Gortyn Laws.</note>
The Gortyn Laws throw some light on the subject.
</p>

<p>
As long as the father is alive, no man shall buy or
receive in pledge from the son any of the father's
property. But what the son himself has earned, or
inherited, he may sell if he like.
</p>

<p>
So too the father may not dispose of the goods of
the children which they have earned or inherited.
</p>

<p>
Yet may a son's prospective share in his paternal
inheritance be sold to pay any legal fine he has
incurred.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Gortyn Laws</hi>, iv. 29-31.</note>
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">But the land was in theory inalienable from the family.</note>
There is no joint holding here between father and
son. The father is in undisputed possession, and
nothing the son can do by private contract can affect
his father's occupation. But if the son had a right
of maintenance from his father during the lifetime of
both, his expectation of succession to an equal share
with his brothers would give him, so to speak, a value
<pb n="094"/><anchor id="Pg094"/>
in the public eye. In the event of his incurring a
blood-fine, his father would presumably be obliged to
pay it out of the patrimony; and when exaction of
such penalties passed into the hands of a court, exception
would hardly be made for long on behalf of
the fine for murder over penalties for other crimes
coming before the court. Although therefore for all
ordinary purposes a son had no claim on the paternal
estate beyond his maintenance, his right of succession
might easily grow up in the eye of the law as an
available asset capable of forfeiture with the theoretical
assumption that the scapegrace was unfit to hold
his position in the family.<note place="foot"><p>Cf. <hi rend='italic'>Ordinances of
Manu</hi>, ix. 213-4. <q>If an eldest (brother), through avarice, commit an injury

<q>None of the brothers who perform wrong acts <emph>deserve</emph> (share
in) <emph>the property</emph>, ...</q>
</p></note> His future portion, thus
becoming deprived of a representative, might be wholly
or in part confiscated to the State. There are many
inscriptions confiscating to the State the goods of
criminals who transgressed the laws therein; but Plato
evidently contemplated the possibility of wiping out
the individual without depriving his descendants of
their inheritance.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Laws</hi>, 877 c.</note>
In such a case as wife-murder, he
says, the husband's right of maintenance is extinguished
from amongst his family, he should be banished
and his name wiped out for ever, whilst his sons or
relations enter upon the inheritance of his property
<emph>immediately</emph>. No distinction is made by Plato, or in
the Gortyn Laws in such a case between chattels
and land. But inasmuch as all fines would be levied
<pb n="095"/><anchor id="Pg095"/>
in the first instance upon the property of the guilty
individual, it may be assumed that his own earnings
went first, and that only in extreme cases would the
ancestral land of the family be sold. Even then, in
Israelite law, it was expected that the land would be
<emph>redeemed</emph> by the nearest relative,<note place="foot">Lev. xxv. 25;
Jerem. xxxii. 8.</note> so that the result
would be that the land would go out of the family
only when no relative could be found rich enough to
pay the fine out of his chattels.

<note place="margin">Close analogy in the custom of Gavelkind in Kent.</note>
It is interesting to find analogous provisions in
the customs of Gavelkind of ancient Kent. Under
the system of Gavelkind equal division of property
amongst sons obstinately held its own against the
incursions of the right of primogeniture; and the
connection of the family with their land seems to
have been regarded as especially privileged in spite
of the growth of Feudalism.

His introduction and admission to a phratria and

holding land. Yet the knowledge of his real parentage
bereft him of the right of sharing equally with the

<head>§ 4. Tenure Of Land In Homer: The Κλῆρος And The Τέμενος.</head>

<p>
<note place="margin">The βασιλεύς and his τέμενος contrasted with the
tribesman and his κλῆρος.</note>
In the Homeric poems, written, as they are, from
an aristocratic or heroic point of view, a great gulf
always exists between the royal or princely class and
the ordinary tribesmen.
</p>

<p>
The βασιλεύς&mdash;the lion of his people<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Il.</hi>
xx. 165.</note>&mdash;has his
select estate, his τέμενος, with orchards and gardens
of considerable extent; while the swarms of tribesmen
are allotted their κλῆροι in the open field, their
share in the common pasture, and depend on each
other for help in the vintage and harvest.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">The possessions of the βασιλεύς.</note>
The possession of large estates and of multitudinous
flocks and herds was one of the privileges of the
chieftain or tribesman of princely rank.
</p>

<quote rend="display">
<q>For surely his livelihood (<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi> Odysseus') was great past
telling, no lord in the dark mainland had so much, nor any in Ithaka
itself; nay, not twenty men together have wealth so great, and I will

as many flocks of sheep, as many droves of swine, as many ranging
herds of goats, that his own shepherds and strangers pasture. And
ranging herds of goats, eleven in all, graze here by the extremity
of the island with trusty men to watch
them.</q><note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Od.</hi> xiv. 96.</note>

<p>
Bellerophon migrated from his own country and
settled under the patronage of the king of
Lykia.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Il.</hi> vi. 194.</note>
He married the king's daughter, and to complete his
qualification and to confirm his princely status as a
βασιλεύς of Lykia, he was allotted by the Lykians an
estate where the plain was fattest on the banks of the
<pb n="103"/><anchor id="Pg103"/>
river, consisting half of arable, half of vineyard, the
latter presumably on the slopes of the sides of the
valley.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Il.</hi> ix. 574;
<hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi> xx. 184.</note>
Besides these no doubt he had flocks and herds on the
mountains, with steadings and slaves for their protection.
It is improbable that the fattest of the plain
was unoccupied before, and it must therefore be
supposed that the system of agriculture was such as
to admit of such a partition and the consequent readjustment,
or that the dispossessed tribesmen had to
compensate themselves with land out of the common
waste.
</p>

<p>
In somewhat similar wise Tydeus at Argos wedded
one of the daughters of Adrastos, and dwelt in a
house full of livelihood; and <q>wheatbearing ἄρουραι

<p>
In the description of the Shield of Achilles in the

harvest of the βασιλεύς and the busy toil of the
tribesmen.

<quote rend="display">

<p>
Land was brought into cultivation, no doubt, as it
was wanted. Achilles contemplates that some of the
rich fields of his friends may be exceedingly remote, so
that it would be a great thing to spare the ploughman a
journey to the nearest blacksmith. And no doubt
the powerful men of the community would, by means
of their slaves or retainers, acquire additional wealth
by reclaiming lands out of the way and therefore
requiring a strong hand to protect them, which were
profitable by reason of their very fatness.<note place="foot">πίονες ἀγροί.

acquisitions would not be included in the τέμενος of
the prince, the very word τέμενος implying an area of
land cut out of the cultivated land of the community,
generally described as being in the plain (πέδιον).
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">The βασιλεύς <q>honoured like a god with gift
of a τέμενος.</q></note>
Such allotments of land seem only to have been
made to princes and gods, but when once allotted,
remained as far as can be seen the property of their
descendants. It was a common fancy of the Homeric
prince that he was worshipped as a god, and they
often mistook each other for some deity. The godlike
Sarpedon asks his cousin Glaukos, wherefore are
they two honoured in Lykia as gods, with flesh and
full cups and a great τέμενος.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Il.</hi> xii.

</p>

<p>
As the possession of full tribal blood was necessary
for the ownership of a κλῆρος, so princely blood
was the qualification for the enjoyment of a τέμενος.
<pb n="106"/><anchor id="Pg106"/>
The honoured individual need not be a king or overlord,
but besides his valour he must have in his veins
the all-potent blood royal, without which his privilege
was no greater than that of other rich tribesmen.

<p>
It was not till the king of Lykia had satisfied

This great τέμενος on
the banks of the Xanthos, half arable and half

<p>
The kingship itself in Ithaka was considered as
part of Telemachos' patrimony: <q>Never may Kronion
<pb n="107"/><anchor id="Pg107"/>

</p>

<p>
But though the τέμενος and the kingship were
both equally πατρώια, they did not together constitute
an indivisible inheritance. Any one of the
blood could enjoy possession of the land, whilst the
over-lordship must necessarily descend in the eldest
or the most able line.
</p>

<p>
In his answer to the malignant wish quoted above,
Telemachos does not speak as if he contemplated
giving up any tangible property. The bestowal of
the kingship, though due to him by inheritance
(πατρώιον) is in the hands of the gods; he means
to be master (ἄναξ) of whatsoever Odysseus his
father won for him.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">Iason's claim upon his great-grandfather's estate.</note>
It is interesting to compare this choice of
Telemachos with the exactly opposite choice made by
Iason, as told by Pindar, when he came back to claim
his inheritance which had been seized in the meantime
by his second cousin, Pelias.
</p>

<p>
He has come home, he tells Pelias, to seek his
father's ancient honour which Zeus had of old
bestowed on his great-grandfather Aiolos and his
sons. It is not for them now, being of the same
stock (ὁμόγονοι), to divide the great honour of their
forefathers with sword and javelin. He will give up
all the sheep and herds of kine, and all the fields of
late robbed from his sires, though they make fat
beyond measure the house of Pelias (τεὸν οἶκον πορσύνοντ᾽
<pb n="108"/><anchor id="Pg108"/>
ἄγαν). But the kingly sceptre and throne of his
father must be his without wrath between them. And
Zeus, the ancestral god of them both (Ζεὺς ὁ γενέθλιος
ἀμφοτέροις), is witness to their oath.<note place="foot">Pindar,

<p>
<note place="margin">Rich tribesman might hold several κλῆροι.</note>
Property in land could also be accumulated in the

by reason of his valour.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Od.</hi> xiv. 211.</note>
The κλῆρος must therefore
at that time have been at any rate roughly of some
recognised area. Perhaps the tendency, so fatal to
Sparta, for the possession of the original shares or
allotments of many families to accumulate in the
hands of the powerful or rich, had already set in. In
later colonisations and assignments of new land the
κλῆροι were often equally divided,<note place="foot">Cf. <hi rend='italic'>Il.</hi>
xii. 421. περὶ ἴσης.</note> and the gift
of citizenship, as has been already mentioned, was
sometimes accompanied by a grant of a <hi rend='italic'>half-kleros</hi>
(ἡμικλήριον). Did the κλῆρος then represent in
theory an area of cultivated ground capable of sustaining
a single household?

<head>§ 5. Early Evidence <hi rend='italic'>continued</hi>: The Κλῆρος
And The Maintenance Of The οἶκος.</head>

<p>
<note place="margin">The κλῆρος was the holding of the head of an οἶκος.</note>
There are signs in Homer of the existence,
already insisted upon for later times, of the connection
of the ownership of property with the headship
of a household. It follows that if the head of a
<pb n="109"/><anchor id="Pg109"/>
family was the only owner of land, the desire of
establishing a family and thereby preserving at the
same time the acquired property and the name of the
possessor, made the acquisition of a wife a real
necessity for the owner of land.
</p>

<p>
Eumaios, the swineherd, says that Odysseus would
have given him a property (κτῆσις), both an οἶκος and
a κλῆρος and a shapely wife.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Od.</hi> xiv. 62.</note>
And Odysseus in one
of his many autobiographies speaks of taking a wife
as if it were the necessary sequel to coming into his
inheritance.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Od.</hi> xiv. 211.</note>
</p>

<p>
Even Hesiod, the son of a poor settler, without
much property to keep together, if we can take
Aristotle's reading of the line, gives the necessary
outfit for a peasant farmer in occupation of a small
κλῆρος, as a house, a wife, and a plough-ox.<note place="foot">Wks. and Dys. 405. The
next line which explains that the
woman is to be slave and <emph>not</emph> a
wife is evidently a later addition.
Aristotle did not know it, and
interpreted γυνη as wife.</note>
</p>

<p>
Aristotle quotes this line of Hesiod, in his argument
that the οἶκος was the association formed to supply
the wants of each day,<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Pol.</hi> i. 2, 5-7.</note>
its members being
called by Charondas, he says, ὁμοσίπυοι (sharers in the
mealbin), and by Epimenides the Cretan ὁμόκαποι
(sharers of the same plot of ground).<note place="foot"> I am indebted to Professor
Ridgeway for the right meaning
and derivation of this word, which
stands for ὁμόκηποι, having the α
long and not short as stated in
Liddell and Scott's Dictionary.
Another reading is ὁμόκαπνοι which
would mean sharers of the smoke
or hearth.</note> And he might
have added that Pindar uses the word ὁμόκλαροι to
mean <q>twins.</q><note place="foot">Pindar, <hi rend='italic'>Nem.</hi> ix. 11.</note>
</p>

<pb n="110"/><anchor id="Pg110"/>

A household, according to Aristotle, consisted

property.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Œcon.</hi> i. 2. μέρη δὲ οἰκίας

</p>

<p>
So closely is the idea of livelihood bound up
that of the house or οἶκος, that Telemachos can say
without incongruity that his house is being <emph>eaten</emph> by
the wooers:&mdash;
</p>

The sanctity shared by the hearth and its sustenance
may be illustrated by Odysseus' oath, which
occurs three times in the <hi rend='italic'>Odyssey</hi>: <q>Now be Zeus my

</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">Force of the bond of food.</note>
When once the hospitable board had laid its
mysterious spell on the relations of host and guest,
the bond was not easily dissolved. Glaukos and
Diomedes meet <q>in the mid-space of the foes eager
to do battle,</q> fighting on opposite sides. Nevertheless
because the grandfather of one had entertained the
grandfather of the other for twenty days and they
had parted with gifts of friendship, their grandsons
refrain from battle with each other, pledge their faith,
and exchange armour as a witness to others that they
are guest-friends by inheritance (ὄφρα καὶ οἵδε γνῶσιν,
ὅτι ξεῖνοι πατρώιοι εὐχόμεθ᾽
εἶναι).<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Il.</hi> vi. 230.</note>
</p>

<p>
If such force lay in the entertainment of a guest
for a few days, some idea can be formed of the virtue
underlying the meaning of such words as ὁμοσίπυοι
<pb n="111"/><anchor id="Pg111"/>
and ὁμόκαποι, and binding together those habitually
nourished at the same board.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">The need of an established household strongly felt.</note>
If sons married during their father's lifetime
without any particular means of livelihood, they
could live under his roof and authority, forming a
great patriarchal household like that of Priam and
his married sons and daughters at Troy. But when
a household dispersed before the marriage of the sons
and the inheritance was divided amongst them, it was
deemed indispensable for them to take wives, and
each provide for the establishment of his house and
succession. This necessity is the underlying motive
of the compulsion over the only daughter left as
ἐπίκληρος to marry before a certain age, exercised by
the Archon at Athens. There the idea of the need
of a continuous family (as well as for other purposes),
to keep together the property, had grown up apparently
as a reflection, so to speak, of the obvious
importance of the property to the family for the
maintenance of itself and its ancestral rites.
</p>

<p>
Though evidence is wanting for the <hi rend='italic'>raison d'être</hi>
of this sentiment in Homer, the existence of the
feeling can hardly be denied.
</p>

<p>
The κλῆρος, at any rate, continued to pass from
father to son in the family of the tribesman or citizen.
Hector encourages his soldiers by reminding them
that though they themselves fall in the fight, their
children, their house (οἶκος), and their κλῆρος will be
unharmed, provided only that the enemy are driven
back.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Il.</hi> xv. 497.</note>
</p>

<p>
The sentiment that a man was not really <q>established,</q>
<pb n="112"/><anchor id="Pg112"/>
according to the estimation of the Homeric
Greeks, until the continuity of his house was provided
for, seems to explain the two references to Telemachos
in the <hi rend='italic'>Iliad</hi>. Odysseus is twice mentioned, as Mr.
Leaf points out in his <hi rend='italic'>Companion to the
Iliad</hi>,<note place="foot">p. 75. Mr. Leaf mentions
other countries where the father takes a new name as father of his
eldest son.</note> as
the father of Telemachos, simply because it was considered
a title of honour to be named as sire of an
established house. No other mention of Telemachos
occurs in the <hi rend='italic'>Iliad</hi>.
</p>

<p>
Failure of heirs was, as in later times, the great
disintegrating factor and danger to the continuity of
the family holdings. As long as a direct descendant
was to be found, the property was safe.

<note place="margin">Revenue from land in ancient Egypt.</note>
Sesostris is said to have obtained his revenue
from the holders of κλῆροι in Egypt in proportion to
the amount of land in each man's occupation;<note place="foot">Herod. ii. 109.</note> and
Pharaoh, having bought all the land at the time
of the famine in Egypt except that which supported
the priests, took one-fifth of all the produce, leaving
the remainder <q>for seed of the field,</q> and for the food
of the cultivators, and their households and little

</p>

<p>
In this case Pharaoh became proprietor by purchase
of the land in Egypt. But it must not be
supposed that by exacting a payment from the
occupier, the overlord as a rule had any power over
the ownership of the soil. He no doubt had proprietary
rights over his own estate, and may or may
not have had power to regulate any further distribution
of the waste. But the right of receiving
dues, or of appointing another to receive them,
gave him no power over the actual tillage of the
soil.

<p>
<note place="margin">Grants of land to the prince easily made, in their
elastic system of agriculture.</note>
The maintenance of the prince was a first charge
apparently upon the property of his subjects; and
it is easy to see how the lion's share would always
be allotted to him, alike of booty as of acquired
territory. As long as the community was pastoral,
it is also easy to imagine how the chief both increased
his own wealth and admitted favoured companions or
resident strangers to a share in the elastic area of
<pb n="118"/><anchor id="Pg118"/>
the common pasturage. After agriculture had
assumed equal importance in the economy of the
tribe as the tending of flocks and herds, one is apt
to forget that for centuries&mdash;perhaps for thousands
of years&mdash;the system of agriculture that grew up,
still possessed much of the elasticity of the old
pastoral methods. Under the open field system,
such a custom as that described by Tacitus and in
the Welsh Laws, viz. of ploughing up out of the
pasture or waste sufficient to admit of each tribesman
having his due allotment, and letting it lie waste
again the next year, admitted of considerable readjustment
to meet the exigencies of declining population,
as well as providing an easy means whereby
any stranger prince, like Bellerophon, who might be
admitted to the tribe, could be allotted either a
τέμενος apart, or a κλῆρος in the open plain.

Pindar describes this method of cultivation when
he says:&mdash;

<head>§ 7. Summary Of The Early Evidence.</head>

<p>
It may be useful here briefly to summarise the
results of the inquiry of the last three sections into
the relation of the ownership of land to the structure
of society in Homer and in early times.
</p>

<pb n="121"/><anchor id="Pg121"/>

<p>
<note place="margin">The chief's land apart from the tribesmen's.</note>
the princes had their compact estates divided off
from the other land of the community, so that a
passer-by could point and say, <q>There is the king's
τέμενος.</q><note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Od.</hi> vi. 293.</note>
The ordinary tribesman on the other hand
had a share in the common fields under cultivation,
probably consisting of a number of scattered pieces of
land lying mixed up with those of others, and therefore
only referred to on the face of the land, under
the comprehensive terms ἀγροὶ καὶ ἔργα
ἀνθρώπων.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Ib.</hi> 259.</note>
</p>

<p>
This share of the tribesman was, as in later times,
called a κλῆρος, it being possible for a man to enjoy
several such holdings and deserve the epithet
πολύκληρος, whilst the lowest class of freemen consisted
of those who possessed no land, under the
ignominious title of ἄκληρος.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">The land sustained the householder in his duties to other
members and guests.</note>
The κλῆρος, descending from father to son, was
apparently connected with the οἶκος or household,
and supplied its maintenance. The οἶκος grew fat or
was consumed in accordance with the capacity of its
head, and its continuity was regarded as a matter of the
utmost importance. Its members were bound together
at their ancestral hearth by mutual ties of common
maintenance. The sanctity of thus sharing the same
loaf extended also to guests, whose relations to their
hosts might last for several generations. It is the
necessity of supplying the οἶκος and its dependents
with the means of sustenance and hospitality among
a pastoral people gradually adapting themselves to
agriculture, that regulates the tenure of land and the
duties of the householder.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">The chief had the right to demand gifts from the people;</note>
The power of the chieftain to draw upon the resources
<pb n="122"/><anchor id="Pg122"/>
of his people for the entertainment of his
household and his guests by exactions payable in kind,
supplemented by the power he also seems to have
possessed to transfer at will the right of receiving
these <q>gifts</q> to any one he chose, seems to contain
the germs of the more complicated system of food-rents
as a condition of land tenure, which is so important
a feature of the Celtic tribal arrangements.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">he had tribal right to a τέμενος, as the tribesman to
a κλῆρος,</note>
Inasmuch as the prince was a member of the tribe,
he was entitled to an allotment in the land under
cultivation, the very word κλῆρος implying the
equal right of all members of the tribe to a share in
the soil. But inasmuch as the prince possessed
blood royal and claimed his descent from the very
gods that the tribesmen worshipped, his dignity was
above partaking with his tribesmen of a κλῆρος in
the common fields. He was therefore allotted a
τέμενος apart, and worthy of his divine parentage.
Besides the bare single allotment of the τέμενος, land
was set apart for him as a gift of honour by the
people, from whom honour and gifts to their prince
were due. Gifts in land formed a special mark of
honour, and may at the same time have served
another purpose from the giver's point of view by way
of a permanent source of income or endowment, as it
were, whereby the continuous exactions towards the
maintenance of the prince from the lands of the
people might tend to be alleviated. Thus much of
power over the property of his inferiors he undoubtedly
retained, and he probably cultivated what
he liked of the outlying lands under his sway.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">but could not deprive the tribesman of his land.</note>
But the evidence does not show that he ever had

<pb n="123"/><anchor id="Pg123"/>
and their κλῆρος: the only means at his disposal
of severing the link between the family and the

acquire the <q>inheritance</q> of the ancestral vineyard of

<head>§ 8. Hesiod And His Κλήρος.</head>

<p>
In the time of Hesiod, the κλῆρος<note place="foot">The κλῆρος is spoken of as
capable of good cultivation by means of a yoke of oxen.</note> could be sold in
case of need and added to the possession of another.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">Hesiod an immigrant: not a typical case of a family.</note>
But the case of Hesiod is in itself somewhat
exceptional. His father had fled from his own country
by stress of poverty, and settled on the barren
land of Askra in Boeotia, where he was allowed to
acquire some land.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Works and Days</hi> 637.
Possession of land would presuppose admission to full civic rights. <hi rend='italic'>V.

648; xvi. 59.</note> and, true to the
Homeric doctrine, was unencumbered by the claims of
kindred. Hesiod contrasts the ready help of the
neighbour with the perfunctory slowness of the
kinsman, duty-bound. The neighbour, he says, is
prompted by the need of mutual protection of
material property, the kinsman stays to bind on his
sandals and gird his loins for the labour he is forbidden
to shirk.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>W. and D.</hi> 345 &amp;c. γείτονες

</p>

<p>
Hesiod and his brother Perses had divided the
κλῆρος of their father into two, and lived apart.
Perses had squandered his half, and spent his time
<pb n="124"/><anchor id="Pg124"/>
and his livelihood in the gay life of the town, but
none the less seems to have expected to be allowed to
draw still further on the resources of the paternal
property, to the distress of his industrious brother.
</p>

<p>
Hesiod does not contemplate any possible means
of making a living other than by tilling the soil;
and his quaint ideas may be taken as typical of the
small Boeotian peasant-farmer, allowance being
made for the short time that his family had held land
at Askra.

<head>§ 9. Survivals Of Family Land In Later Times.</head>

<p>
<note place="margin">Land was in theory inalienable from the family.</note>
In later Greek writers it is several times stated that
the κλῆροι or ἀρχαῖαι μοῖραι were inalienable. Yet
all remark to what a deplorable extent the alienation
and accumulation of land into few hands had been
carried. Aristotle comments on the excellence of the
ancient law, at one time prevalent in many cities,
against the sale of the original κλῆροι, and the good
purpose therein of making every one cultivate his own
moderate-sized holding.<note place="foot">Arist. <hi rend='italic'>Pol.</hi>
VIII. ii. 5. ἦν δὲ τό γε ἀρχαῖον ἐν πολλαῖς πόλεσι νενομοθετημένον μηδὲ πωλεῖν ἐχεῖναι

</p>

<p>
Innumerable passages could be quoted from the
speeches of Isaeus, referring to the law that forbade
any one to alienate by will his landed estate from his
lawful sons. Plato warns his friends that buying
and selling is desecration to the god-given

Sparta.
</p>

<p>

Plutarch's evidence, late as it is, of the ancient

passed in succession from father to son&mdash;ἐν διαδοχαῖς

</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">who decided as to its maintenance.</note>
The important part of this ceremony at Sparta,
described by Plutarch, seems to be the introduction
of the infant to the elders of the tribe, and the recognition
by them of its right to maintenance, if it
<pb n="126"/><anchor id="Pg126"/>
appeared to them physically worthy of admission
to the tribe. It cannot be supposed that Plutarch
believed that vacant κλῆροι escheated, so to speak,
to the community, because he elsewhere describes
the lamentable tendency of estates to get into few
hands, which the community would in that case
surely have been able somewhat to prevent. Nor is
it likely that a κλῆρος was actually set apart for the
maintenance of each infant, who was apparently still
nourished in its father's house until seven years old,
when its education and occupations were regulated by
the State.
</p>

<p>
Reading this passage with the other in the <hi rend='italic'>Life
of Agis</hi>, a natural inference is, that the child's right
to succeed to the property of his father only was
thereby assured to him by the elders, <hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi> the right
on his attaining manhood to enjoy the possession
of land. This is the view taken by M. de
Coulanges;<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Nouvelles Recherches</hi>, 1891, p.
63.</note> but surely there is more underlying the account of
the ceremony. What actually took place with regard
to the allotment of a κλῆρος to the infant member of
the tribe, cannot be decided here. The State at
Sparta undertook to educate all her sons after a certain
age, and gave the parent no further rights over
the child. Is there in this ceremony a transfer of
the claim for maintenance from against the head of
the household to the larger unit represented by the
elders of the tribe, irrespective of the inheritance
of the son from his father?
</p>

<p>
It would be necessary for the adult Spartan citizen,
of the class of ὁμοιοι at any rate, to have a right to the
<pb n="127"/><anchor id="Pg127"/>
produce of some land, as otherwise it is difficult to
see how he could contribute the necessary provisions
that formed his share of maintenance at the joint
table of his <hi rend='italic'>syssition</hi>; unless indeed he drew his
allowance from his father's estate.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">Maintenance derived from the κλῆρος.</note>
In any case the idea of the dependence of a
member of the tribe for sustenance upon his right
to a κλῆρος is striking; and at the same time the
evidence goes to show that his maintenance was a
claim upon a group of kinsmen at Sparta, comprising
more than the nearest relations, and was recognised
as such by them.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">The family bound to their land at Athens;</note>
The link that bound the cultivators to their land
was so strong in early times at Athens, that mortgages
could apparently not be paid off by mere
transfer of the land itself; but the whole family of
the debtor went with their mortgaged property and
became enslaved to the creditor, having in future to
work the land for him at a fixed charge.
</p>

<p>
This was the state of affairs that Solon set himself
to mend, and it is instructive that the method, he
seems to have chosen, was to loosen the tie between
the owner and his land, and, by facilitating the
transfer of land from one to another, to obviate the
necessity of taking the debtor's person with his
family into slavery on account of the debt.<note place="foot">Arist.
<hi rend='italic'>Pol. Ath.</hi> 2 and 5.</note>
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, in spite of the radical legislation of
Solon, the sentiment that bound the family to the
soil remained long after his time.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">and in Lokris.</note>
Besides the prohibition to sell the family land
which Aristotle speaks of as prevailing in Lokris, the
<pb n="128"/><anchor id="Pg128"/>
Hypoknemidian Lokrians insisted on actual residence
on that land in the case of their colony at Naupaktos.
Though unable apparently wholly to forbid the participation
of the colonists in the ancestral rites of
their kin in Lokris, they took advantage of the prevailing
sentiment with regard to the permanence of
the family, and insisted that the continuance of the
hearth of the colonist at Naupaktos should at any
rate be considered of equal importance.

<head>§ 10. The Idea Of Family Land Applied Also To
Leasehold And Semi-Servile Tenure.</head>

<p>
<note place="margin">Further application of the idea of family land.</note>
Attention has been drawn to the reciprocal relations
that existed between the family and its land,
and their inseparability in the minds and phraseology
of the Greeks at different times. There is a further
development however arising from this point of view,
without some notice of which the subject of the tenure
of the κλῆρος would be incomplete, and which serves to
confirm the method with which this subject has been
treated.
</p>

<p>
Though alike in their estimation of the possession
of land as a means of livelihood and for the accumulation
of wealth, the Greeks had very different views
with respect to the place of agriculture as a worthy
occupation for a citizen. Sparta regarded it as
entirely beneath the dignity of her sons and forbade
their personal application to the cultivation of their
κλῆροι. There was at Athens, on the other hand, a
large class of citizens whose energies were entirely
devoted to the production of fruits of the earth, whilst
<pb n="130"/><anchor id="Pg130"/>
the life of a country gentleman, combined with that
of the farmer, was by no means despicable in their
eyes.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">Two methods of occupation of land: (1) by owner
himself; (2) by subject population.</note>
There were mainly two methods of enjoying the
possession of a landed estate. Either the land was
cultivated by the owner himself with the help of
bought slaves or hired servants, few or many, as described
in Hesiod and the <hi rend='italic'>Oeconomics</hi> of
Xenophon;<note place="foot">Cf. <hi rend='italic'>Thuc.</hi> ii. 16 for Attica.
Such are the numerous small farmers who appear in the plays
of Aristophanes.</note>
or the owner resided in the city or a neighbouring
town, and the land was tilled by aliens or serfs
(called sometimes κλαρῶται), like the Helots of Sparta,
who paid an annual contribution from the produce
to their landlord. The serf was often attached hereditarily
to the soil in the sense of being unable to
give up his holding, but also had certain rights as
against his master, both in the matter of his own
possessions and in that he could not be sold out of
the country.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Athen.</hi> vi. 85. Βοιωτῶν
(φησὶν Ἀρχέμαχος) τῶν τὴν Ἀρναίαν κατοικισάντων οἱ μὴ ἀπάραντες εἰς
τὴν Βοιωτίαν, ἀλλ᾽ ἐμφιλοχωρήσαντες παρέδωκαν ἑαυτοὺς τοῖς Θετταλοῖς
δουλεύειν καθ᾽ ὁμολογίας, ἐφ᾽ ῴ οὔτε ἐξάξουσιν αὐτοὺς ἐκ τῆς χώρας οὔτε
ἀποκτενοῦσιν, αὐτοὶ δὲ τὴν χώραν αὐτοῖς ἐργαζόμενοι τὰς συντάξεις

</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">At Gortyn on extinction of citizen-family the κλαρῶται
inherited.</note>
There is a passage in the Gortyn Laws that
states:&mdash;that if there are no rightful successors to
inherit the property of a deceased Gortynian, his
household's κλῆρος, <hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi> the persons composing it,
shall inherit his property. That is to say, if a
Gortynian family died out and no legal representative
could be found, their proprietary rights were extinguished
and the κλαρῶται who lived upon the land took
all their property. This provision favours the idea
<pb n="131"/><anchor id="Pg131"/>
that at Gortyn also the citizen-population came of a
race of conquerors, who were not exactly looked upon
as ground landlords upon whose land a subject family
was settled or had been allowed to remain, but that,
whilst the relation of the κλαρῶται to their land was
of the closest if not an absolute bondage to the soil,
the proprietary rights of their superiors and masters
consisted of the conqueror's overlordship and the
power to derive their maintenance from the joint
produce of their serfs' labour and the land.<note place="foot"><p>Gortyn. v. 25.
αἱ δὲ μὴ εἶεν ἐπιβάλλοντες τᾶς ϝοικίας οἵτινες κ᾽
ἴωντι ὁ κλᾶρος, τούτονς ἔκεν τὰ κρήματα. The words τᾶς ϝοικίας
should be taken with οἵτινες, &amp;c, rather than with the preceding
words. οἵτινες κ᾽ ἴωντι ὁ κλᾶρος is equivalent to οἱ κλαρῶται.
</p>
<p>
See Dareste, &amp;c, <hi rend='italic'>Inscript.
Jurid. Gr.</hi> p. 463.
</p></note>
</p>

<p>
This comprehensive use of the word κλῆρος, as
meaning both the allotment of land and the family
who were bound to occupy it, whose labour also
created its value to its lord and master, is quite
consistent with the use of the word in reference to
the holdings of the Spartan citizens. The allotment
of a κλῆρος at Sparta evidently meant also a transference
of rights over the Helots that worked it; and
even if this further implication was not actually
included in the meaning of the word, it was so
inseparable in thought that no explanation was
necessary of the composite significance of the allotment.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">Similar twofold tenure in the Athenian κληρουχίαι.</note>
The Athenians in their κληρουχίαι seem instinctively
to have combined these two methods of agriculture.
The κληροῦχοι were not colonists, who became citizens
of a new city, but they remained citizens of Athens,
holding however their κλῆροι in a remote district.
<pb n="132"/><anchor id="Pg132"/>
But the chief feature of this method of landholding
was that the owner, though remaining a citizen of
Athens and liable to the same claims from the mother
city in respect of military service, &amp;c, as before, was
yet supposed to reside in the neighbourhood of his
new κλῆρος. This was the case, even when the land
itself was left in the hands of the conquered population
at a fixed annual charge.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">Examples in Salamis,</note>
An inscription found on the Acropolis of Athens,
and relating to some date about 560 or 570 B.C.,
defines the legal status of the first κληροῦχοι sent to
Salamis. They were assimilated to Athenian citizens
as to taxes and military service; but they must
reside on their land under pain of an absentee's tax
to the State.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Mittheil. Inst. Ath.</hi> ix. p.
117. The original number of κληροῦχοι in this case was apparently
five hundred.</note>
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">in Lesbos,</note>
In the year 427 B.C. the Athenians conquered
the island of Lesbos. They imposed no tribute on
the subjugated islanders, but, making the land into
three thousand κλῆροι <q>except the Methymnian land,</q>
they first set apart three hundred κλῆροι as sacred to
the gods, and on to the others they sent off κληροῦχοι
chosen by lot from themselves; to these the
Lesbians paid annually for each κλῆροι two minae,
and <emph>themselves worked the land</emph>.<note place="foot">Thuc. iii. 50.</note>
</p>

<p>
According to the account of Aelian, the same
method of procedure was adopted after the conquest
of Euboea in about 510 B.C. The Athenians, having
conquered the Chalkidians, apportioned their land to
κληροῦχοι<note place="foot">κατεκληρούχησαν.</note>
in two thousand κλῆροι, <hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi> the country
<pb n="133"/><anchor id="Pg133"/>
called Hippobotos; and, setting aside τεμένη to Athena
in the place called Lelantos, they let out<note place="foot">ἐμίσθωσαν.</note> the rest
according to the pillars that stand in the King's
Stoa, which thus bear record of the leases.<note place="foot">Aelian,
<hi rend='italic'>V. II.</hi> vi. I. <hi rend='italic'>Cf.</hi>
Herod, v. 77 and vi. 100.</note>
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">Each κλῆρος therefore supported two families.</note>
The holding of each κληροῦχος may have varied
in size according to the character of the soil and
features of the country; but it may safely be
asserted that it must have been of sufficient dimensions,
not only to provide subsistence for the native
population left on the soil, but also to pay a
considerable portion towards the keep of the
κληροῦχος himself, during his enforced residence in
the conquered country.
</p>

<p>
The class of citizen from amongst whom the κληροῦχοι
were chosen by lot, did not consist of families
with much property in Athens.<note place="foot">Smith's <hi rend='italic'>Dicty. of
Antiquities</hi>, s.v. <hi rend='italic'>colonia</hi>.</note> Younger sons
without occupation, whom their fathers had not been
quite callous enough to <q>expose</q> in infancy,<note place="foot">Bekker,
<hi rend='italic'>Charicles</hi>, p. 218.</note> and
restless individuals without property in the mother
country, would be most likely to offer themselves.
And to such the two minae per annum, paid by the
Lesbians from the produce of each κλῆρος, would
appear a reasonable if not a sumptuous provision of
livelihood. There were a hundred drachmae in the
mina, and if it is true, as asserted by Plutarch,<note place="foot">Ridgeway,
<hi rend='italic'>Origin of Currency</hi>, &amp;c., p. 324.</note> that
in the time of Solon one drachma was the price of a
sheep, a yearly income of two hundred sheep, or
their equivalent, would be forthcoming to each
<pb n="134"/><anchor id="Pg134"/>
κληροῦχος&mdash;surely a considerable contribution to the
maintenance of his family.<note place="foot">The ordinary Athenian dicast
is supposed to have subsisted largely upon his pay of three
obols or a half-drachma <hi rend='italic'>per diem</hi>.</note>
</p>

<p>
Under these circumstances each κλῆρος served to
provide maintenance for two households&mdash;both of
whom had hereditary rights therein, though themselves
in different strata of society. Both households
also were in a sort attached to the soil, the one in
practical bondage, the other bound by law to reside
in the country wherein lay its substance, and (if we
may use the common expression of the Welsh Laws)
its privilege.

<p>
<note place="margin">The same double ownership in leases <q>for ever.</q></note>
This double and continuous ownership was not
confined to the semi-servile tenure of lands annexed

</p>

<p>
Leases to be handed down from father to son

the trustees on perpetual lease&mdash;εἰς πατρικά&mdash;as the
patrimonial substance of his family, for himself and
his issue or whosoever should take inheritance from

A. The tribe (φυλή) of the
Otorkondeis at the advice of their
treasurers and led by the priest of
Artemis, decide to purchase from
Thraseas, son of Polites son of
Melas of Grab ... and adopted
son of Heracleitos son of Heracleides
of Ogonda, lands (γέας) in the
Ombian plain with the sixty-two
ranks of vines, three olive trees,
and all the other trees without
reserve, also lands elsewhere with
the trees without reserve for 5,000
drachmae of light Rhodian silver,
provided that Thraseas has the
sale registered with sureties.
Moreover, Thraseas coming to the
ekklesia declared that he was ready
to manage these things: and the
sale having taken place of the said
(properties) to the trustees in the
name of the god. Thraseas himself
then and there took on lease
all the said (properties) from
the treasurers of the tribe: and
he shall hold them (εἰς πατρικά)
for his patrimony, himself and his
issue or those to whomsoever the
inheritance of his goods passes,
and he shall pay annually to the
treasurers of the tribe 100 and ...
drachmae, without fail or fraud.
</p>
<p>
B. ... all the land and trees
which Thraseas has bought from
Artemisia, daughter of Hekataios
of Ketambissos, without exception
in these places either in the
matter of the share he took in the
division with his brother or of
what he bought from Artemisia, all
for 7,000 drachmae of light silver
of Rhodes, provided that Thraseas
register the sale and give sureties.
And coming before the ekklesia
Thraseas declared that he was
prepared to manage this; and the
sale of the foregoing having taken
place to the trustees in the name
of the god, Thraseas himself then
and there took on lease all the
foregoing from the treasurers of
the tribe: and he shall hold them
(εἰς πατρικά) for his patrimony,
himself and his issue or those to
whom the inheritance passes, and
he shall pay annually to the treasurers
of the tribe 300 drachmae.

<p>
The rent forms part of the
revenues of the god. If Thraseas
gets more than two years in arrear,
the contract is annulled.

He shall not divide the land or
share the rent (οὐ παραχωρήσει δὲ

<p>
<note place="margin">Perhaps due to the prevailing idea of the
family as a continuing unit.</note>
Do not these instances show that even leases were
included in the same category with actual ownership
of land, being embraced within the characteristic idea
that the land that contributed to the maintenance of
the family and had come to be regarded almost as
giving that family its social if not its political status,
should descend unintermittently from generation to
generation in that family, though its occupation was
subject to providing support likewise to a superior
owner and his family, whose descendants in their turn
also would demand their share in the produce?
</p>

<p>
Is the conclusion justified that the basis of this
indomitable feeling was that the peculiar view of the
family, as consisting of a long line of past and future
representatives, precluded the individual, who happened
to be the living representative at any given
time, from taking an irresponsible position as absolute
master of the property, upon which his family had
been, was, and would be dependent?

<head>Chapter V. Conclusion.</head>

<p>
<note place="margin">No final word can yet be said.</note>
In weighing the results of this essay, it
would be absurd to pretend that anything of the
nature of a last word can be said on the subject.
The process of the early development of Greek
society cannot be ascertained merely from the study
of a few survivals in historic times. The comparative
method must be carried much further
than has been attempted here, before the secrets of
antiquity can be laid bare and an authoritative
statement made.
</p>

<p>
There would seem, however, to be at any rate
some points, of those that have come under notice,
worthy of further investigation, in so far as
they indicate that Greek society was no isolated
growth, but must be given a place in the general
development of the systems of Europe.

<p>
<note place="margin">Explanation of the structure of the kindred to
be found in the descent of city life from earlier stage of
tribal society.</note>
It is suggested that in the continuity of city life
from an earlier stage of society under some form of
the Tribal System, can be found the only natural
explanation of the structure of the kindred at Athens
in the fourth and fifth centuries <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> Comparison
<pb n="138"/><anchor id="Pg138"/>
with the customs of other nations,&mdash;the Hindoos, the
Welsh, and the Israelites, the last two being the most
typical examples of peoples of which we have written
records whilst still living under the tribal system&mdash;has
shown remarkable analogies in the organisation of
their inner society.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">Similarity between the bond of tribal blood and
that of citizenship.</note>
The actual similarity in the sentiment which surrounded
the possession of the privileges of tribal
blood and the title to citizenship at Athens, can
hardly be exaggerated.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">The threefold bond:&mdash;</note>
The foundation of the bond in either case has a
threefold aspect. The bond is one of blood, of
religion, and of maintenance.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">(1) the bond of blood;</note>
The qualification for citizenship, as much as for
the tribal privilege, was a question of parentage;
and the citizen equally inherited, with his blood,
responsibilities towards the community into which
he was born, as to a larger kindred.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">(2) the bond of religion;</note>
Membership of the tribe or of the city was the
only qualification, that admitted to the privilege and
duty of partaking in the public religious observances.
Tribesmen and citizens, by virtue of their privilege,
shared in the worship of the greater gods, of Hestia
in the Prytaneum, of Zeus Agoraios, and of the
Heroes or special guardians of their community;
in like manner as the member of the smaller group
of a kindred, by virtue of his blood, shared in the
worship of the Apollo Patroïos, the Zeus Herkeios or
Ktesios, and the heroes or ancestors of his family.
Inasmuch as citizenship depended upon purity of
descent, the possession of the latter qualification
carried with it the right to share in the greater
ceremonies. But the converse was equally stringent,
<pb n="139"/><anchor id="Pg139"/>
in that the possession of shrines of Apollo Patroïos
and Zeus Herkeios was impossible, unless the family
was one of those who had for many generations been
recognised as belonging to the true stock of the
community.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">(3) the bond of maintenance.</note>
Inasmuch as the worship of private or public
gods consisted mainly of offerings of food, of beasts
or produce of the earth, and wine, every tribesman
or citizen must have had the means of providing his
share in the offerings, besides supporting himself and
his family. Those devoted to handicraft or merchandise
were often despised by the regular tribesman or
citizen, and sometimes therefore formed separate clans
by themselves, like the smiths in Arabia. It is not
surprising, therefore, to find that the membership of
the tribe or city should have carried with it the right
to the possession of some portion of the arable land
and of the pasture, upon which all were regarded as
being dependent. In this way the possession of land
was intimately related to the status and the duties
of the owner. It was the visible mark of his full
tribal privilege, and was the practical means of his
fulfilling his duty towards his fellows and the public
religion, as well as to the needs of his ancestors and
household. It seems also to have been believed
that, in partaking of the hospitality or sharing in
the sacrificial feast of any family, a bond was for
the time being created which was in most respects
practically equivalent to relationship by blood to
the members of that family.<note place="foot">Robertson Smith
(<hi rend='italic'>The Religion of the Semites</hi>) holds that the
object of sacrifice was thus to maintain this imaginary kinship
between the deity and the worshippers.</note>
</p>

<pb n="140"/><anchor id="Pg140"/>

<p>
<note place="margin">Many tribal customs survived in the
kindred and the household.</note>
Apart from the tribal character of the qualification
for citizenship, the most conservative organisation
wherein had been stereotyped the most precious of
tribal customs, was that of the kindred.
</p>

<p>
It is suggested that the vitality of the customs
surrounding the bond of family relationship was due
to the importance attached to the religious and social
functions incumbent on all members of a household
united by kindred blood. The actions of the individual
members were constrained by their weighty
responsibilities towards the continuance and prosperity
of the composite household, in which they moved, and
apart from which their existence could not but be
altogether incomplete.
</p>

<p>
The worship of ancestors occupied a prominent
place in the needs of the Athenian household, and, no
doubt, had a corresponding influence in the preservation
of its unity. The same of course cannot be
said for Wales, where Christianity had replaced, in the
records at any rate, whatever religious beliefs may
have existed earlier. But the grouping of the kindred
according to grades of relationship was adhered to by
the Welsh as an intrinsic part of their very conception
of a kindred; and this would point to the conclusion
that such subdivisions were due to wider needs than
can be found in any particular form of religious
belief or worship.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">But these survivals mostly found in post-Homeric records.</note>
If, as has been suggested, in adhering to these
customs, the Greeks were still treading in the tracks
of their tribal ancestors, how is it that the most
convincing evidence comes from as late as the fifth
and fourth centuries <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> and mainly from the most
highly civilised of the cities of Greece?
</p>

<pb n="141"/><anchor id="Pg141"/>

<p>
The <hi rend='italic'>Iliad</hi> and the <hi rend='italic'>Odyssey</hi> may perhaps be
trusted as truly portraying, so far as they go, the
manners and customs of the great period of Achaian
civilisation, known as Mycenean, which may be said
to have culminated just before the Dorian invasion.
Whence then came the public recognition of those
household ceremonies of ancestor-worship, which filled
such a large place in the life of the Athenian citizen,
and which, it has been suggested, were consciously
or unconsciously slurred over by the Homeric
poets?
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">They perhaps belonged to the pre-Achaian inhabitants
of Greece.</note>
Mr. Walter Leaf has already found an answer to
this question,<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Companion to the Iliad</hi>, pp.
6-7.</note> viz. that these ceremonies were the
long cherished customs of the ancient Ionian or
Pelasgian inhabitants of Greece, who had formed the
substratum of society under Achaian rule, and who
only came into prominence on the removal of their
superiors at the time of the Dorian invasion. And
this continuity, underlying the superficial rule of the
Achaians, seems to be borne out by recent research
and discovery.<note place="foot">Since the foregoing chapters
were in print, I have had the benefit of seeing Herr Erwin Rohde's
admirable work, entitled <hi rend='italic'>Psyche</hi>
(Freiburg and Leipsig, 1894). His view is that the worship of Heroes
had the complete form of ancestor-worship: that, ancestors being
buried at the hearth, or in the family tomb on private ground,
death made no break in the membership of the family. And he
claims that the <hi rend='italic'>Seelencult</hi> or ancestor-worship
of the later Greeks must have been continuous from
pre-Homeric times.</note>
</p>

<p>
The Athenians always boasted their Ionian descent,
and may well have inherited their habits with the
traditions of their origin.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">But many were probably of wider parentage.</note>
But the customs reviewed in the foregoing
<pb n="142"/><anchor id="Pg142"/>
pages seem to have a wider parentage than
can be attributed to the Pelasgians alone. Spartan
customs at any rate cannot thus be accounted
for.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">Comparison with the history of the Jews.</note>
In the course of argument reference has often
been made to the Jewish records in the Books of the
Old Testament, and indeed a remarkable parallel is
presented in the history of the two peoples. Both
peoples apparently reached their greatest period
about the same time. The reign of Solomon with
its gold and costly workmanship must have resembled
that of the Mycenean kings in more than similarity
of date, and outward splendour. Taking Homer
again as the courtly chronicler of the Achaian age of
gold, the Books of the Kings of both peoples are
curiously conscious of their former tribal conditions,
through which they easily trace back to the very
fountain-head of their race.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">Reaction in times of distress to earlier tribal
habits by the Jews, and perhaps by the Achaians.</note>
In the period of the decay of the Jewish people
under the stress of invasion by foreign kings, strenuous
efforts were made by their prophet leaders to
purge them from the alien blood and alien influences
contracted in the careless days of their prosperity.
Their aim was to restore once more those strict tribal
habits which had served them so well at the time of
their own victorious invasion, and which still lay dormant
in their constitution. In similar wise, the period
of Achaian prosperity seems to have been followed by
a rise into prominence at any rate, if not an actual
resuscitation, of old tribal customs.
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">These tribal habits probably only dormant
throughout and common to all Greeks,</note>
The actual traces of tribal institutions in Homer
need not be underrated. There is much that is of a
tribal character in the Homeric chieftain in his relations
<pb n="143"/><anchor id="Pg143"/>
to his tribesmen and to their gods. Survivals
of tribal custom may also be seen in the reverence
for the guest, and the sacredness of the bond of
hospitality lasting as it did for generations; and in
the blood-feud with its deadly consequences, especially
when occurring within the tribe or kindred. Indeed
if only the Pentateuch of the Achaians could be found
in the ruins of Mycenae and added to the Homeric
Book of the Kings, would it not then probably be
evident that there was much more of a tribal nature
in the organisation of the kindreds of the Achaians
and surviving throughout the whole period of their
splendour than the aristocratic poets of the Homeric
schools allowed themselves to record?
</p>

<p>
<note place="margin">if not practically even to all tribal systems.</note>
Although therefore nearly all our evidence of the
internal structure of the kindred among the Greeks
dates from the fifth century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi>, the ἀγχιστεία at
Athens must not be put down as belonging merely to
that period. In the light of the close analogies to
be found in the structure of other tribal systems,
it is probable that such subdivisions of the kindred
belong to an extremely early period in the history
of the Greeks, whether as Achaians or Ionians or
Dorians. Are they not indeed necessary features of
tribal society itself wherever it is examined?
