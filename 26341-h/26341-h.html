<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These notes, brief as they are, owe more than can
be told to my father's researches into the structure
and methods of the Tribal System. They owe their
existence to his inspiration and encouragement. A
suitable place for them might possibly be found in
an Appendix to his recently published volume on
the Structure of the Tribal System in Wales.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In ascribing to the structure of Athenian Society
a direct parentage amongst tribal institutions, I am
dealing with a subject which I feel to be open to
considerable criticism. And I am anxious that the
matters considered in this essay should be judged
on their own merits, even though, in pursuing the
method adopted herein, I may have quite inadequately
laid the case before the reader.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My thanks are due, for their ready help, to
Professor W. Ridgeway, Mr. James W. Headlam,
and Mr. Henry Lee Warner, by means of whose
kind suggestions the following pages have been
weeded of several of their faults.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is impossible to say how much I have consciously
or unconsciously absorbed from the works
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagevi">[pg vi]</span><a name="Pgvi" id="Pgvi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the late M. Fustel de Coulanges. His <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">La Cité
Antique</span></span> and his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nouvelles Recherches sur quelques
Problèmes d'Histoire</span></span> (1891) are stores of suggestive
material for the student of Greek and Roman
customs. They are rendered all the more instructive
by the charm of his style and method. I
have merely dipped a bucket into his well.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In quoting from Homer, I have made free use
of the translations of Messrs. Lang, Leaf, and Myers
of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Iliad</span></span>, and of Messrs. Butcher and Lang of
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Odyssey</span></span>; and I wish to make full acknowledgment
here of the debt that I owe to them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some explanation seems to be needful of the
method pursued in this essay with regard to the
comparison of Greek customs with those of other
countries. The selection for comparison has been
entirely arbitrary.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Wales has been chosen to bear the brunt of
illustration, partly, as I have said, because of my
father's work on the Welsh Tribal System, partly
because the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ancient Laws of Wales</span></span> afford a
peculiarly vivid glimpse into the inner organisation
of a tribal people, such as cannot be obtained
elsewhere.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ordinances of Manu</span></span>, on the other hand,
are constantly quoted by writers on Greek institutions;
and, I suppose, in spite of the uncertainty
of their date, they can be taken as affording a very
fair account of the customs of a highly developed
Eastern people. It would be hard, moreover, to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagevii">[pg vii]</span><a name="Pgvii" id="Pgvii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
say where the connection of the Greeks with the
East began or ended.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The use made of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Old Testament</span></span> in these
notes hardly needs further remark. Of no people,
in their true tribal condition before their settlement,
have we a more graphic account than of the
Israelites. Their proximity geographically to the
Phœnicians, and the accounts of the widespread
fame of Solomon and the range of his commerce,
at once suggest comparison with the parallel and
contemporaneous period of Achaian history, immediately
preceding the Dorian invasion, when, if we
may trust the accounts of Homer, the intercourse
between the shores of the Mediterranean must have
been considerable.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All reference to records of Roman customs has
been omitted, not because they are not related or
analogous to the Greek, but because they could not
reasonably be brought within the scope of this
essay. The ancestor-worship among the Romans
was so complete, and the organisation of their
kindreds so highly developed, that they deserve
treatment on their own basis, and are sufficient to
form the subject of a separate volume.

In trying to ascertain the course of social development
among the Greeks, the inquirer is met by an
initial difficulty. The Greeks were not one great
people like the Israelites, migrating into and settling
in a new country, flowing with milk and honey.
Their movements were erratic and various, and took
place at very different times. Several partial migrations
are described in Homer, and others are referred to as
having taken place only a few generations back.
The continuation of unsettled life must have had the
effect of giving cohesion to the individual sections
into which the Greeks were divided, in proportion as
the process of settlement was protracted and difficult.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But in spite of divergencies caused by natural
surroundings, by the hostility or subservience of
previous occupants of the soil, there are some features
of the tribal system, wherever it is examined, so
inherent in its structure as to seem almost indelible.
A new civilisation was not formed to fit into the angles
of city walls. Even modification could take place
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page002">[pg 002]</span><a name="Pg002" id="Pg002" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
only of those customs whose roots did not strike too
deeply into the essence of the composition of tribal
society.

It is the object of these notes to try to put back
in their true setting some of the conditions prevailing,
sometimes incongruously with city life, among the
Greeks in historical times, and by comparison with
analogous survivals in known tribal communities, of
whose condition we have fuller records, to establish
their real historical continuity from an earlier stage
of habit and belief.

There were three important public places necessary
to every Greek community and symbolical to the
Greek mind of the very foundations of their institutions.
These were:—the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Agora</span></span> or place of assembly,
the place of justice, and the place of religious sacrifice.
From these three sacred precincts the man who stirred
up civil strife, who was at war with his own people,
cut himself off. Such an one is described in Homer

Mr. Frazer, in his article in the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Journal of Philology</span></span><a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href="#note_8"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a> upon the resemblance of the Prytaneum in
Greece to the Temple of Vesta in Rome, shows that
both had a direct connection with, if not an absolute
origin in the domestic hearth of the chieftain. The
Lares and Penates worshipped in the Temple of Vesta,
he says, were originally the Lares and Penates of the
king, and were worshipped at his hearth, the only
difference between the hearth in the temple and the
hearth in the king's house being the absence of the
royal householder.<a id="noteref_9" name="noteref_9" href="#note_9"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mr. Frazer also maintains that the reverence for
the hearth and the concentration of such reverence
on the hearth of the chieftain was the result of the
difficulty of kindling a fire from rubbing sticks together,
and of the responsibility thus devolving
upon the chieftain unfailingly to provide fire for
his people. Whether this was the origin or not,
before the times that come within the scope of this
inquiry, the hearth had acquired a real sanctity
which had become involved in the larger idea of it
as the centre of a kindred, including on occasion the
mysterious presence also of long dead ancestors.

Although the religious life of the Greeks was
always complex, there is not to be found in Homer
the broad distinction drawn afterwards between
public and private gods. It is noticeable that the
later Greeks sought to draw into their homes the
beneficent influence of one or other of the greater
gods, whose protection and guidance were claimed in
times of need by all members of the household.
Secondary influences, though none the less strongly
felt, were those of the past heroes of the house,
sometimes only just dead, to be propitiated at the
family tombs or hearth. Anxiety on this head, and
the deeply-rooted belief in the real need to the dead
of attentions from the living, were, it will be seen,
most powerful factors in the development of Greek
society.

Is the right conclusion then that the Homeric
Greeks did not sacrifice at the tombs of their fathers,
and that the so-called ancestor-worship prevalent later
was introduced or revived under their successors? Or
is it that the aristocratic tone of the poet did not

any deity besides the one great family of Olympic
gods, less venerable than a river or other personification
of nature?<a id="noteref_15" name="noteref_15" href="#note_15"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">15</span></span></a>

reverence displayed towards the hearth and the
respect for seniority in age, it may perhaps be
justifiable to suppose that domestic religious observances,

It was not necessary for an ancestor to become
a god to be worthy of worship, or to need the
attentions of the living. If he was thought to haunt
tomb or hearth, and to keep his connection thus
with his family in the upper world, he required
nourishment on his visits. He was also considered
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page009">[pg 009]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

A close resemblance in this point lies between

yet the stress laid on the permanence of the family,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">lest the name of the dead be cut off from his place</span></span>,
is quite in keeping with the request of Elpenor to
Odysseus to insure the continuance of his name in
the memory of living men.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is quite possible that, as the story of the interview
of Odysseus with the dead reveals that the idea of
the dead enjoying sacrifices of food and drink was
familiar at that time, even though the periodical supply
of such is not mentioned, so the existence of Laban's
household gods and the gathering of the kindred of
Jesse to their family ceremony<a id="noteref_17" name="noteref_17" href="#note_17"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">17</span></span></a> may bear witness to
the presence of a survival of ancestor-worship in some
equivalent form, underlying the all-absorbing religion
of the Israelites. At this day the spirits of Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob are considered by the Mohammedans
of Hebron actually to inhabit the cave of Machpelah,
and, in the case of Isaac at any rate, to be extremely
angered by any negligence shown to their altars,
either by omission of the customary ceremonies or by
admission within the sacred precinct of any stranger
of alien faith.

The ceremonies however and offerings at the
tombs of their fathers did not supersede, amongst
the Athenians at any rate, their worship of the

In the next chapters frequent reference will be
made to the offerings to ancestors, or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">manes</span></span>, among
the ancient Hindoos. With them the cake-offering
to the dead became a most important symbol, uniting
in a common duty all descendants from certain ancestors
within fixed degrees, and marking them off in
the matter of responsibility thereto from more distant
relations, who owed similar duty elsewhere.

Being thus surrounded by nations that believed
intensely in the need in the dead of nourishment at
the hands of their relatives on earth, it would indeed
be surprising if the Greeks were found not to share in
the belief. But the fact remains that in the earliest
Greek literature it is least conspicuous, and the gulf
seems widest between the living and the dead. Can
this be laid to the charge of the artificial superstitions
of a philosophical class of poets? Or is it due to the
true evolution of such beliefs, that as long as our
search touches upon the unsettled periods of semi-migratory
life, the tombs of individual members of a
family being scattered here or there wherever they
meet their deaths, the offering to the dead takes a
special form, inasmuch as the solidarity of the tribe
eclipses the importance of the family as a unit, and
the religious ceremonies of the chieftain absorb the
attention of the lesser members of the tribe?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
M. de Coulanges points out that the meaning of
the Latin word <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lar</span></span> is lord, prince or master, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page013">[pg 013]</span><a name="Pg013" id="Pg013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hestia</span></span> was sometimes designated by the Greeks
with the similar title of mistress of the house, or
princess.<a id="noteref_27" name="noteref_27" href="#note_27"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">27</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If, as long as the tribe was felt to be a real unit,
the religious instincts of the tribesmen were concentrated
upon the worship of their tribal deities—the
great ancestors of the tribe, and more emphatically
and directly the ancestors of their chieftain—it would
be quite natural, in the weakening of the central worship,
for the titles of honour and respect to be used
equally towards those meaner ancestors who henceforth
occupied the religious energies of the head of
each family or household. In fulfilment of a similar
sentiment, the later Greeks commonly used the word
ἥρως in speaking of a dead friend, deeming that any
one who departed this life passed to the ranks of
those princes of the community from whom all were
proud to trace descent.

M. de Coulanges considers that the sacred rites of
the family at the hearth formed a more real tie than
the belief in a common blood; and that upon this
religious basis was built up the greater hearth of the
Prytaneum as the centre of city life, to bind together
the several families composing the community. But
without pretending to come to a final decision on
this the main tendency of social development, surely
something may yet be said in favour of the contrary
theory; that the reverence that centred in the hearth
was in effect the expression of the sanctity of the tie
of blood, as felt by all members of the house, and that
this feeling drew its real importance for the community,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page014">[pg 014]</span><a name="Pg014" id="Pg014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
not from the founding of the city by the
amalgamation of several families, but as a survival
from an earlier stage of life, when society circled
round what was then in more than name the Prytaneum
of the tribal chieftain.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Facts are wanting to justify a conclusion as to
which of these theories bears the closest resemblance
to the truth, but it is easy to imagine what might
be the line of development if the latter hypothesis be
maintained.
</p>

During the wanderings and migrations of peoples
in the search for greener pastures or broader lands,
each community or tribe would be constantly under
arms and subject to attack from the enemies they
were passing through or subjugating. This constant
sojourning in a strange land, surrounded by foes,
would be a source of much solidarity to the tribe
itself, drawing its members closely together for
mutual defence and subsistence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But when once the tribe had found a country to
its taste, and had made a settlement with borders comparatively
permanently established, emphasis would
be transferred to the petty quarrels and internal dissensions
arising between different sections within the
community itself. The tie of common blood, uniting
all members of the tribe, would be gradually disregarded
and displaced by the less homely and more
political relation of fellow-citizenship, which, though
retaining many of the characteristics of the tribal
bond, would necessarily be felt in a very different
manner.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In this disintegration of the larger unit, the
existence of kinship by blood would be acknowledged
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg 015]</span><a name="Pg015" id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
only where the relationship was obvious and well
known. And it would no longer be sufficient merely
to prove membership of a kindred; as those outside
certain limits would claim exemption from the
responsibilities entailed by closer relationship.

So, too, in the matter of religious observance:
the reverence of the individual for the Prytaneum
and common hearth of the state would undergo a
change into a less personal sentiment; the rites
connected therewith would be delegated to an official
priest; and it is with the head of each family, surrounded
by those who are really conscious of their
connection by blood in common descent from much
more immediate ancestors, that the true tribal feeling
would longest survive, though, of course, on much
narrower lines.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The privileges of citizenship were, it will be seen,
as carefully guarded as those of the tribe, but in a
more perfunctory and arbitrary manner; whilst the
intimate connection of the members of the family
with the hearth and the graves of their ancestors
stands out in strong relief.

As the hearth was the centre of the sanctity and
reverence of the family, so the word οἶκος was the customary
term to signify the smaller group of the composite
γένος, consisting of a man and his immediate
descendants. In the first place, the individual was
absolutely committed to sacrifice all his personal feelings
for the sake of the continuity of his οἶκος, and this
was his supreme duty. But whereas several οἶκοι
traced their descent from a common ancestor, a
group of gradually diverging lines of descent
were formed, sharing mutually the responsibility
of the maintenance of continuity, and the privilege
of inheritance and protection.

he must fulfil all the ordinances incumbent on one

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg 021]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

rested always with the possession of the blood of the
former owners; and such a representative demonstrated
his right by stepping into his predecessor's
shoes and by taking upon himself all responsibility
for the fulfilment of the rites, thereafter to be performed
to him also when he shall have been gathered

only of transmission. She could only inherit

Such was the scorn felt for the man who refused
to perform the duties of nearest kinsman. In the
thirty-eighth chapter of Genesis is told the story of
Tamar, the wife of Judah's eldest son who died childless.
The second son's refusal to raise up seed to his
brother because he knows that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">his own name will not
be perpetuated thereby, but his brother's</span></em>, meets with
summary punishment. <span class="tei tei-q">“And the thing that he did

Afterwards, when it was reported to her
father-in-law that Tamar had a child by some one not
of his family, he was exceedingly wroth, and said,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Bring her forth and let her be burnt.”</span> Accordingly,
after he had received his own <span class="tei tei-q">“tokens”</span> from her hand,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page031">[pg 031]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his approval of her action, in her desire to perpetuate
the name of her dead husband, is all the more
striking, and shows how real such a claim as Tamar's
was in the practice of those days, extreme though
her action was felt to be. And Judah acknowledged
his tokens and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“She hath been more righteous

The statement of the customary procedure in
Deuteronomy is very picturesquely illustrated and
fulfilled in detail in the story of Ruth, who though
only a daughter-in-law takes the position of heiress
through a sort of adoption by her mother-in-law
Naomi, on her refusal to go back to her own people.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Where thou goest, I will go: where thou lodgest, I
will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy
God, my God. Where thou diest will I die, and

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Elimelech and his two sons dying in Moab, Naomi
and both her daughters-in-law are left widows in a
strange land. If Naomi had other sons, upon them
would have devolved the duty of taking Orpah and

too old to marry again and be the mother of sons, and implores
her daughters-in-law to return to their own people in
Moab, where she hopes they will start afresh with
new husbands, a course which seems always to have
been open to wives in tribal communities. Orpah
does so, but Ruth elects to remain with Naomi, and
returning with her to Bethlehem takes her chance
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page032">[pg 032]</span><a name="Pg032" id="Pg032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
among the kindred of Elimelech. Happening to
arrive at Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley
harvest, it so chances that Ruth goes forth to glean
upon that part of the open field which belonged to
Boaz—a rich man of the συγγενία of Elimelech, who,
having heard of her devotion to Naomi and the house
of his late kinsmen, protects her from possible insult
from strangers and treats her richly. On her return
home Naomi informs her that Boaz is of their next

The story of Ruth is not, therefore, an exact
example of the custom of levirate. But it illustrates
incidentally the unity of the family. The sons of
Elimelech died before the family division had taken
place, and the house of Elimelech their father was
thus in jeopardy of extinction. If Naomi had come
within the proper operation of the levirate, the next
of kin ought to have married <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">her</span></em>, but by her adoption
of Ruth as her daughter, she gave Ruth the position
of heiress or ἐπίκληρος, whilst the heir born to Ruth
was called son, not of Ruth's former or present husband,
but of Elimelech and (by courtesy) of Naomi, Elimelech's
widow, through whom the issue ought otherwise
to have been found.

absolutely: her son must entirely leave her husband's

Herein lay the reason that adoption became so
favourite a means in classical times of securing an
heir. It became almost a habit among the Athenians
who had no sons, to adopt an heir—often even the
next of kin who would naturally have succeeded to
the inheritance.<a id="noteref_78" name="noteref_78" href="#note_78"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">78</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The transfer of the adopted son from the οἶκος of
his father to the οἶκος he was chosen to represent
was so real that he lost all claim to inheritance in his
original family, and henceforth based his relationship
and rights of kinship from his new position as son of
his adoptive father. This absolutely insured the childless
man that his successor would not merge the
inheritance in that of another οἶκος, and made it
extremely unlikely that he would neglect his religious
duties as they would be henceforth his own ancestral
rites.

share in the disgrace brought upon their family.
In such a case presumably their father's house would
be allowed to become extinct.

show him to the kinsmen (συγγενεῖς or γεννῆται) and
phratores: he must give assurance on the sacrifices
that the young man was born in lawful wedlock from
free citizens. This done, and no one questioning his

was in his favour, then and not till then he was enrolled
in the common register (εἰς τὸ κοινὸν γραμματεῖον) of
the phratria in the name of son of his adopted father.
As a father could not without reason disinherit his
true-born sons, so the phratores could not without
reason refuse to accept them to the kinship.<a id="noteref_84" name="noteref_84" href="#note_84"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">84</span></span></a>

The introduction into the deme which took place at

Such being the character of the burden of mutual

When examining the more detailed structure of

tribes into that of settled provinces or

Even when feudalism refused to acknowledge
other than an individual responsibility for a fief, it
was unable to overcome the tribal theory of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page050">[pg 050]</span><a name="Pg050" id="Pg050" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
indivisibility of the family, which maintained its unity
in some places even under a feudal exterior. But as
generations proceeded, and the relationships within
the family diverged beyond the degree of second
cousin, a natural breaking up seems to have taken
place, though in the direction of subinfeudation under
the feudal enforcement of the rule of primogeniture,
instead of the practice, more in accordance with
tribal instincts, of equal division and enfranchisement.
It may however be surmised that the subdivision
and subinfeudation of a holding in the occupation
of such a group of kinsmen would be carried
out by the formation of further similar groups.

The head of the family would himself offer or

The group, thus sharing the same cake-offering,
would in the natural course be moving continually

to pass from the receivers of the cake-offering
to the receivers of the water libation, and admitting
the great-grandson's son into the number of Sapindas

more than four generations have a share in the same
cake offered to the three nearest ancestors of the head

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

are great-grandsons of the great-grandsons of their

second cousins.

It was extremely improbable that a man would
see further than his great-grandchildren born to him
before his death. And it might also occasionally
occur in times of war or invasion that a man's sons

leaving the old man and his young great-grandchildren
at home.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If the fighting members of the family were
killed, the great-grandsons (who would be second
cousins or nearer to each other) would have to
inherit directly from their great-grandfather: and
thus, especially in cases where the property was held
undivided after the father's death, we can easily see
that second cousins (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> all who traced back to the
common great-grandfather) might be looked upon as
forming a natural limit to the immediate descendants
in any one οἶκος, and as the furthest removed who
could claim shares of the ancestral inheritance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After the death of the great-grandfather or head
of the house, his descendants would probably wish
to divide up the estate and start new houses of their
own. The eldest son was generally named after his
father's father,<a id="noteref_140" name="noteref_140" href="#note_140"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">140</span></span></a>

would be responsible for the proper maintenance of
the rites on that ancestor's tomb. He would also
be guardian of any brotherless woman or minor
amongst his cousins, each of whom would be equally
responsible to him and to each other for all the duties
and privileges entailed upon blood-relationship.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus seems naturally to spring up an inner

It appears from the evidence reviewed hitherto,
that any great-grandson could inherit from any
grandson of a common ancestor, and the conclusion
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page059">[pg 059]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
also seems to be justified, that the group of great-grandsons
were considered to divide up their right to
inherit once for all, and that having done so, with
respect to that inheritance they were considered to
have begun a new succession. To put it differently,
in case of the death of one of these second cousins,
after the final division of their inheritance had taken
place, the rest of the second cousins would have no
right to a share in his portion; an heir would
have to be found within his nearer relations. Thus,
they share responsibilities towards any of their
relations within the group and higher up in their
families, and also stand shoulder to shoulder in sharing
such burdens as pollution and so on, but are outside
the immediate ἀγχιστεία with respect to each
other's succession. The reason for this will perhaps
be more apparent as the argument proceeds.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

Before dishonouring one of the family and so
bereaving it of a member owing duties which, by his
disinheritance, may fall into abeyance or be neglected,
the parent calls together all to whom his son might
perhaps ultimately become the only living representative

be dependent on him for the performance of ancestral
rites. That this was in Plato's mind when he wrote
is shown by the next sentence, in which he provides
for the possibility of some relation already having
need of the young man and being desirous to adopt
him as his son, in which case he shall by no means
be prevented. The concurrence of all relations in

Theopompos, in the speech of Isaeus, had taken
possession of the estate of his second cousin Hagnias,
as his next of kin and heir. Throughout the speech
he is styled ἀνεψιοῦ παῖς so as to bring him

defends himself from the claims of the next
generation below—viz., his brother's son. But in the
speech of Demosthenes against his son Makartatos,
who had taken possession at his father's death of the
disputed property, it is represented that his father
had got possession only by defeating another
claimant, Phylomache II., by <span class="tei tei-q">“surprise,”</span> as it was

caused their son Euboulides III. to be adopted as the
son of Euboulides II.—his wife's father and Hagnias'
first cousin, a quite regular course for the grandson
inheriting through his heiress mother—proved that
his wife's grandmother was whole sister to Hagnias

Demosthenes against Makartatos. This Euboulides

Succession to the inheritance of an estate was
ordained by law in strict accordance with the ancient

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page065">[pg 065]</span><a name="Pg065" id="Pg065" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
voluntarily continued unbroken by his descendants,
the natural course was for each son ultimately to live
apart and found a separate οἶκος consisting of himself
and his offspring. Equal division amongst heirs was
therefore the rule in Greece; equal division, that is to
say, between all of equal grade.

were either his sons, or his grandsons, or his greatgrandsons.
If he had no children, his brothers, and
their children, or their grandchildren succeeded.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Athenian law was conceived in the same
spirit, but mentions a further point—viz., that in the
division amongst sons, the οἶκος of any one of their
number who had died before the division, could be
represented by his sons or grandsons, who thus
received their father's share.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This system of representation probably existed
also among the Gortynians, though no mention of it
is made in their laws, for it is inconceivable that any
of the grandsons could be deprived of all share in
their grandfather's estate by the mere death of the
intermediate generation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the division <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">per stirpes</span></span> was not maintained
throughout. It is probable from the words of the
Attic orators that equal division amongst all of the
same grade, such as nephews or cousins, took place
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">per capita</span></span>, any deceased member of that grade being
represented by his sons. Representation, of course,
could not take place in the case of a division amongst
cousins' sons, owing to the strict limitation of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page066">[pg 066]</span><a name="Pg066" id="Pg066" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ἀγχιστεία to four generations from the common ancestor;
any deceased relation in that degree therefore
simply dropped out of the succession.

It has generally been assumed that grandsons
inheriting directly from their grandfather, all the
intermediate generation being already dead, inherited
none the less the shares of their respective fathers
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">per stirpes</span></span>. But if the foregoing account of the
unity of the οἶκος and its resemblance in its composition
to the household of the Welsh tribal system be
correct, it seems more reasonable to suppose that, all
the intermediate generation being dead, the grandsons,
in virtue of being all equally related to their
grandfather, would inherit in equal shares <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">per capita</span></span>.
Any dead grandson would of course be represented,

The evidence is not sufficient to justify more than
a suggestion on either side with regard to divisions
amongst lineal descendants. With regard to successions
by relations outside of the direct line of
descent, such as nephews or cousins, it is almost
certain that all of the same degree took equal shares
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">per capita</span></span>.

inheritance of the property, only one need be dealt with
in view of securing the succession—the assumption can
be made that, when there were several heirs related
in the same degree to the former owner of the estate,
one of their number would be set apart to continue
the household of their kinsman as his son, whilst the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page067">[pg 067]</span><a name="Pg067" id="Pg067" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

The equal division of inheritance amongst kinsmen
of equal degree <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">per capita</span></span>, in combination with the
system of representation above described, is entirely
consistent with the tribal conception of the household
as hanging closely together, its members always
looking up to their venerable head, in whom the
ownership of the property vested, until by the death
of older generations and the consequent subdivision,
each in his turn became head of an οἶκος and owner of

From a passage in Deuteronomy it would appear
that the qualifications for admission as a full tribesman
amongst the Israelites were identical with those
just mentioned.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Israelites had purified themselves of the ancestor
worship, that so long survived in Greece, and
had, if one may say so, amalgamated all their minor
deities and tribal superstitions in their one great monotheistic
religion. Even then their tribal minds could
not carry back their theology behind the known history
of their own ancestors. Their God was the God of
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and was in their conception
the greatest of Gods—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, greater than the
Gods of other peoples, the existence of which their
own beliefs did not preclude. Thus where in Attic
writers we have mention of the religious rites of the
family (which a stranger or polluted man might not
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page070">[pg 070]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
approach), and of the partaking therein as proof of
the whole admission and pure blood of those present,
so in Deuteronomy the expression <span class="tei tei-q">“the Congregation
of the Lord,”</span> is used to denote that sacred
precinct, forbidden to all save pure tribesmen of Israel.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It may be inferred from the following passage
that if a stranger resided in Israel, and his family
continued to do so for nine generations, the tenth
generation would in any ordinary case be admitted
to the Congregation of the Lord as full Israelites.

Citizenship was considered the highest of privileges,

great honour. Any citizen could bring an action
against the newly-admitted stranger to test his real
merits, and even after formal acceptance by the
people of Athens, if he failed to justify his claims at
such a trial, his new honours were stripped from him
and he remained an alien. This being so, it cannot
be expected in the comparison that he should rank
with the ordinary resident in Cymru in the Welsh
Laws, but rather as the chieftain whom the
people wished to honour by admission to their
tribe.

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In order to be perfectly sure that the candidate
was of full and pure blood, they investigated the condition

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page073">[pg 073]</span><a name="Pg073" id="Pg073" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
assured themselves that he had a house and property

his parents or the State.

It was no doubt a wise policy on the part of the
legislators, with the view to the preservation of respect
for life and property, to make the responsibility for
murder rest as widely as possible, and include as
many relations and connections on both sides as might
be. In order also that the wife, in case her husband
was killed, and the daughter, in case her father was
killed, might be fully protected and represented

In Wales the members of the family who received
the galanas, did so in proportion to the importance
of their position in the transmission of the kindred
blood, according to a classification identical with
their proximity in relationship to the dead man,
and their expectation of inheritance from him or succession
to his place.

The inclusion of the mother's relatives and their
liability in these circumstances, in addition to the
paternal relations, follow naturally enough in Wales
as in Greece when once the transmission of inheritance
through a woman, in default of male heirs, had
become a recognised possibility. A woman's sons
might always be called upon under certain circumstances
to take inheritance from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">her</span></em> father or next of
kin. They therefore quite fairly shared in the claims
as well as the privileges of their position. And <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vice

provided by a woman's offspring to her relations,
they too would be prepared to undergo a part

rank some day as their next of kin, or as their
sons.

it does not follow as a matter of course that the property is divided.
It is much more usual that the brothers and sisters, if young,
continue to live together till they either marry or undertake some
employment or business at a distance. If a sister marries, she is
dowered with a sum equivalent to her share. If a brother however
earns a separate income, from whatever source, whether he be
married or remain single, and whether he live in the same or a
different house, or even remove to another town or island, he pays
in all his income to a joint fund, </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">the foundation of which is the

else manage the estate. One brother, perhaps, remains in the
village as cultivator, another lives in the town acting as factor, or
merchant to the estate, receiving and selling the produce and
managing the proceeds, whatever the case may be; and in addition
selling, exporting, and otherwise conducting a general business in
the same department. A third may perhaps receive and sell the
goods in a foreign country. A fourth may be a member of the
legislature, and a fifth a judge. Some marry and have families,
others remain single: but the incomes of all are united, each
draws out a reasonable share, according to his needs, and a very
close account is kept of all transactions. If one brother dies, his
children come into the partnership; and as time goes on, these
again will grow up and marry, the daughters receiving a proportional
and often large dower out of the joint fund, entirely without
reference to the special property of their parents. This may go on
indefinitely: but as family quarrels will arise, </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">there are always

The connection of the possession of land with the
headship of the family finds its counterpart in the
right of maintenance of those who had the true blood

him as the means of sustenance for himself and his
family. Where the head of the family alone was
responsible for the rites to the dead at the family
altars, the position of a son would always be incomplete
if he tried to establish during his father's lifetime
a hearth and household of his own. And it has
been already mentioned that it was necessary to
emancipate a son from the family of his own father,
before he could take property, passing on the death
of his mother's relations to her issue, and assume his
rightful position as their representative and the living
head of their household.<a id="noteref_205" name="noteref_205" href="#note_205"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">205</span></span></a>

Occasionally a father feeling the weight of years
would be glad to pass on to his son during his lifetime
some of his burden of responsibility by making

this case, the son would be responsible for the
maintenance of his parent, a duty much insisted on
by Plato and Isaeus. In fact the conclusion is justified
that the family, until final subdivision into
separate οἶκοι, drew its supplies from the common
inheritance, and that the subdivision of the means of
subsistence was contemporaneous and co-extensive
with the differentiation of the various branches of the
original οἶκος along the lines of the rising generations.

In the meanwhile, before division, all sons had

There is no joint holding here between father and
son. The father is in undisputed possession, and
nothing the son can do by private contract can affect
his father's occupation. But if the son had a right
of maintenance from his father during the lifetime of
both, his expectation of succession to an equal share
with his brothers would give him, so to speak, a value
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page094">[pg 094]</span><a name="Pg094" id="Pg094" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in the public eye. In the event of his incurring a
blood-fine, his father would presumably be obliged to
pay it out of the patrimony; and when exaction of
such penalties passed into the hands of a court, exception
would hardly be made for long on behalf of
the fine for murder over penalties for other crimes
coming before the court. Although therefore for all
ordinary purposes a son had no claim on the paternal
estate beyond his maintenance, his right of succession
might easily grow up in the eye of the law as an
available asset capable of forfeiture with the theoretical
assumption that the scapegrace was unfit to hold
his position in the family.<a id="noteref_220" name="noteref_220" href="#note_220"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">220</span></span></a> His future portion, thus
becoming deprived of a representative, might be wholly
or in part confiscated to the State. There are many
inscriptions confiscating to the State the goods of
criminals who transgressed the laws therein; but Plato
evidently contemplated the possibility of wiping out
the individual without depriving his descendants of
their inheritance.<a id="noteref_221" name="noteref_221" href="#note_221"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">221</span></span></a>
In such a case as wife-murder, he
says, the husband's right of maintenance is extinguished
from amongst his family, he should be banished
and his name wiped out for ever, whilst his sons or
relations enter upon the inheritance of his property
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">immediately</span></em>. No distinction is made by Plato, or in
the Gortyn Laws in such a case between chattels
and land. But inasmuch as all fines would be levied
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page095">[pg 095]</span><a name="Pg095" id="Pg095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in the first instance upon the property of the guilty
individual, it may be assumed that his own earnings
went first, and that only in extreme cases would the
ancestral land of the family be sold. Even then, in
Israelite law, it was expected that the land would be
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">redeemed</span></em> by the nearest relative,<a id="noteref_222" name="noteref_222" href="#note_222"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">222</span></span></a> so that the result
would be that the land would go out of the family
only when no relative could be found rich enough to
pay the fine out of his chattels.

have been regarded as especially privileged in spite

He married the king's daughter, and to complete his
qualification and to confirm his princely status as a
βασιλεύς of Lykia, he was allotted by the Lykians an
estate where the plain was fattest on the banks of the

It is improbable that the fattest of the plain

is the only boundary to be seen to this day between
the strips of cornland in Palestine. Easily dislodged
as these landmarks were, they were specially protected
by a curse against their removal, and were with the
Greeks under the awful shadow of a special deity of

Land was brought into cultivation, no doubt, as it
was wanted. Achilles contemplates that some of the
rich fields of his friends may be exceedingly remote, so
that it would be a great thing to spare the ploughman a
journey to the nearest blacksmith. And no doubt
the powerful men of the community would, by means
of their slaves or retainers, acquire additional wealth
by reclaiming lands out of the way and therefore
requiring a strong hand to protect them, which were
profitable by reason of their very fatness.<a id="noteref_266" name="noteref_266" href="#note_266"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">266</span></span></a> Such

Such allotments of land seem only to have been
made to princes and gods, but when once allotted,
remained as far as can be seen the property of their
descendants. It was a common fancy of the Homeric
prince that he was worshipped as a god, and they
often mistook each other for some deity. The godlike
Sarpedon asks his cousin Glaukos, wherefore are
they two honoured in Lykia as gods, with flesh and
full cups and a great τέμενος.<a id="noteref_267" name="noteref_267" href="#note_267"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">267</span></span></a>

But though the τέμενος and the kingship were
both equally πατρώια, they did not together constitute
an indivisible inheritance. Any one of the
blood could enjoy possession of the land, whilst the
over-lordship must necessarily descend in the eldest
or the most able line.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In his answer to the malignant wish quoted above,
Telemachos does not speak as if he contemplated
giving up any tangible property. The bestowal of
the kingship, though due to him by inheritance
(πατρώιον) is in the hands of the gods; he means
to be master (ἄναξ) of whatsoever Odysseus his
father won for him.

He has come home, he tells Pelias, to seek his
father's ancient honour which Zeus had of old
bestowed on his great-grandfather Aiolos and his
sons. It is not for them now, being of the same
stock (ὁμόγονοι), to divide the great honour of their
forefathers with sword and javelin. He will give up
all the sheep and herds of kine, and all the fields of
late robbed from his sires, though they make fat
beyond measure the house of Pelias (τεὸν οἶκον πορσύνοντ᾽

The κλῆρος must therefore
at that time have been at any rate roughly of some
recognised area. Perhaps the tendency, so fatal to
Sparta, for the possession of the original shares or
allotments of many families to accumulate in the
hands of the powerful or rich, had already set in. In
later colonisations and assignments of new land the

If sons married during their father's lifetime
without any particular means of livelihood, they
could live under his roof and authority, forming a
great patriarchal household like that of Priam and
his married sons and daughters at Troy. But when
a household dispersed before the marriage of the sons
and the inheritance was divided amongst them, it was
deemed indispensable for them to take wives, and
each provide for the establishment of his house and
succession. This necessity is the underlying motive
of the compulsion over the only daughter left as
ἐπίκληρος to marry before a certain age, exercised by
the Archon at Athens. There the idea of the need
of a continuous family (as well as for other purposes),
to keep together the property, had grown up apparently
as a reflection, so to speak, of the obvious
importance of the property to the family for the
maintenance of itself and its ancestral rites.

The maintenance of the prince was a first charge
apparently upon the property of his subjects; and
it is easy to see how the lion's share would always
be allotted to him, alike of booty as of acquired
territory. As long as the community was pastoral,
it is also easy to imagine how the chief both increased
his own wealth and admitted favoured companions or
resident strangers to a share in the elastic area of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the common pasturage. After agriculture had
assumed equal importance in the economy of the
tribe as the tending of flocks and herds, one is apt
to forget that for centuries—perhaps for thousands
of years—the system of agriculture that grew up,
still possessed much of the elasticity of the old
pastoral methods. Under the open field system,
such a custom as that described by Tacitus and in
the Welsh Laws, viz. of ploughing up out of the
pasture or waste sufficient to admit of each tribesman
having his due allotment, and letting it lie waste
again the next year, admitted of considerable readjustment
to meet the exigencies of declining population,
as well as providing an easy means whereby
any stranger prince, like Bellerophon, who might be
admitted to the tribe, could be allotted either a
τέμενος apart, or a κλῆρος in the open plain.

The ordinary tribesman on the other hand
had a share in the common fields under cultivation,
probably consisting of a number of scattered pieces of
land lying mixed up with those of others, and therefore

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This share of the tribesman was, as in later times,
called a κλῆρος, it being possible for a man to enjoy
several such holdings and deserve the epithet
πολύκληρος, whilst the lowest class of freemen consisted
of those who possessed no land, under the
ignominious title of ἄκληρος.

The κλῆρος, descending from father to son, was
apparently connected with the οἶκος or household,
and supplied its maintenance. The οἶκος grew fat or
was consumed in accordance with the capacity of its
head, and its continuity was regarded as a matter of the
utmost importance. Its members were bound together
at their ancestral hearth by mutual ties of common
maintenance. The sanctity of thus sharing the same
loaf extended also to guests, whose relations to their
hosts might last for several generations. It is the
necessity of supplying the οἶκος and its dependents
with the means of sustenance and hospitality among
a pastoral people gradually adapting themselves to
agriculture, that regulates the tenure of land and the
duties of the householder.

Inasmuch as the prince was a member of the tribe,
he was entitled to an allotment in the land under
cultivation, the very word κλῆρος implying the
equal right of all members of the tribe to a share in
the soil. But inasmuch as the prince possessed
blood royal and claimed his descent from the very
gods that the tribesmen worshipped, his dignity was
above partaking with his tribesmen of a κλῆρος in
the common fields. He was therefore allotted a
τέμενος apart, and worthy of his divine parentage.
Besides the bare single allotment of the τέμενος, land
was set apart for him as a gift of honour by the
people, from whom honour and gifts to their prince
were due. Gifts in land formed a special mark of
honour, and may at the same time have served
another purpose from the giver's point of view by way
of a permanent source of income or endowment, as it
were, whereby the continuous exactions towards the
maintenance of the prince from the lands of the
people might tend to be alleviated. Thus much of
power over the property of his inferiors he undoubtedly
retained, and he probably cultivated what
he liked of the outlying lands under his sway.

Homeric doctrine, was unencumbered by the claims of
kindred. Hesiod contrasts the ready help of the
neighbour with the perfunctory slowness of the
kinsman, duty-bound. The neighbour, he says, is

In later Greek writers it is several times stated that

all remark to what a deplorable extent the alienation
and accumulation of land into few hands had been
carried. Aristotle comments on the excellence of the
ancient law, at one time prevalent in many cities,
against the sale of the original κλῆροι, and the good

The important part of this ceremony at Sparta,
described by Plutarch, seems to be the introduction
of the infant to the elders of the tribe, and the recognition
by them of its right to maintenance, if it
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a name="Pg126" id="Pg126" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
appeared to them physically worthy of admission
to the tribe. It cannot be supposed that Plutarch
believed that vacant κλῆροι escheated, so to speak,
to the community, because he elsewhere describes
the lamentable tendency of estates to get into few
hands, which the community would in that case
surely have been able somewhat to prevent. Nor is
it likely that a κλῆρος was actually set apart for the
maintenance of each infant, who was apparently still
nourished in its father's house until seven years old,
when its education and occupations were regulated by
the State.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Reading this passage with the other in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Life
of Agis</span></span>, a natural inference is, that the child's right
to succeed to the property of his father only was
thereby assured to him by the elders, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> the right
on his attaining manhood to enjoy the possession
of land. This is the view taken by M. de
Coulanges;<a id="noteref_330" name="noteref_330" href="#note_330"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">330</span></span></a> but surely there is more underlying the account of
the ceremony. What actually took place with regard
to the allotment of a κλῆρος to the infant member of
the tribe, cannot be decided here. The State at
Sparta undertook to educate all her sons after a certain
age, and gave the parent no further rights over
the child. Is there in this ceremony a transfer of
the claim for maintenance from against the head of
the household to the larger unit represented by the
elders of the tribe, irrespective of the inheritance
of the son from his father?

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It would be necessary for the adult Spartan citizen,

see how he could contribute the necessary provisions
that formed his share of maintenance at the joint
table of his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">syssition</span></span>; unless indeed he drew his

In any case the idea of the dependence of a
member of the tribe for sustenance upon his right
to a κλῆρος is striking; and at the same time the
evidence goes to show that his maintenance was a
claim upon a group of kinsmen at Sparta, comprising
more than the nearest relations, and was recognised
as such by them.

The link that bound the cultivators to their land
was so strong in early times at Athens, that mortgages
could apparently not be paid off by mere
transfer of the land itself; but the whole family of

work the land for him at a fixed charge.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This was the state of affairs that Solon set himself
to mend, and it is instructive that the method, he
seems to have chosen, was to loosen the tie between
the owner and his land, and, by facilitating the
transfer of land from one to another, to obviate the
necessity of taking the debtor's person with his
family into slavery on account of the debt.<a id="noteref_331" name="noteref_331" href="#note_331"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">331</span></span></a>

Attention has been drawn to the reciprocal relations
that existed between the family and its land,
and their inseparability in the minds and phraseology
of the Greeks at different times. There is a further
development however arising from this point of view,
without some notice of which the subject of the tenure
of the κλῆρος would be incomplete, and which serves to
confirm the method with which this subject has been
treated.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Though alike in their estimation of the possession
of land as a means of livelihood and for the accumulation
of wealth, the Greeks had very different views
with respect to the place of agriculture as a worthy
occupation for a citizen. Sparta regarded it as
entirely beneath the dignity of her sons and forbade
their personal application to the cultivation of their
κλῆροι. There was at Athens, on the other hand, a
large class of citizens whose energies were entirely
devoted to the production of fruits of the earth, whilst
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the life of a country gentleman, combined with that
of the farmer, was by no means despicable in their
eyes.

</p><div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">Two methods of occupation of land: (1) by owner
himself; (2) by subject population.</span></div></div><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There were mainly two methods of enjoying the
possession of a landed estate. Either the land was
cultivated by the owner himself with the help of
bought slaves or hired servants, few or many, as described
in Hesiod and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Oeconomics</span></span> of
Xenophon;<a id="noteref_335" name="noteref_335" href="#note_335"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">335</span></span></a>
or the owner resided in the city or a neighbouring
town, and the land was tilled by aliens or serfs
(called sometimes κλαρῶται), like the Helots of Sparta,
who paid an annual contribution from the produce
to their landlord. The serf was often attached hereditarily
to the soil in the sense of being unable to
give up his holding, but also had certain rights as
against his master, both in the matter of his own
possessions and in that he could not be sold out of
the country.<a id="noteref_336" name="noteref_336" href="#note_336"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">336</span></span></a>

There is a passage in the Gortyn Laws that
states:—that if there are no rightful successors to
inherit the property of a deceased Gortynian, his
household's κλῆρος, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> the persons composing it,
shall inherit his property. That is to say, if a
Gortynian family died out and no legal representative
could be found, their proprietary rights were extinguished
and the κλαρῶται who lived upon the land took
all their property. This provision favours the idea
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg 131]</span><a name="Pg131" id="Pg131" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that at Gortyn also the citizen-population came of a
race of conquerors, who were not exactly looked upon
as ground landlords upon whose land a subject family
was settled or had been allowed to remain, but that,
whilst the relation of the κλαρῶται to their land was
of the closest if not an absolute bondage to the soil,
the proprietary rights of their superiors and masters
consisted of the conqueror's overlordship and the
power to derive their maintenance from the joint
produce of their serfs' labour and the land.<a id="noteref_337" name="noteref_337" href="#note_337"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">337</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This comprehensive use of the word κλῆρος, as
meaning both the allotment of land and the family
who were bound to occupy it, whose labour also
created its value to its lord and master, is quite
consistent with the use of the word in reference to
the holdings of the Spartan citizens. The allotment
of a κλῆρος at Sparta evidently meant also a transference
of rights over the Helots that worked it; and
even if this further implication was not actually
included in the meaning of the word, it was so
inseparable in thought that no explanation was
necessary of the composite significance of the allotment.

But the chief feature of this method of landholding
was that the owner, though remaining a citizen of
Athens and liable to the same claims from the mother
city in respect of military service, &amp;c, as before, was
yet supposed to reside in the neighbourhood of his
new κλῆρος. This was the case, even when the land

In weighing the results of this essay, it
would be absurd to pretend that anything of the
nature of a last word can be said on the subject.
The process of the early development of Greek
society cannot be ascertained merely from the study
of a few survivals in historic times. The comparative
method must be carried much further
than has been attempted here, before the secrets of
antiquity can be laid bare and an authoritative
statement made.

There would seem, however, to be at any rate
some points, of those that have come under notice,
worthy of further investigation, in so far as

growth, but must be given a place in the general
development of the systems of Europe.

The qualification for citizenship, as much as for
the tribal privilege, was a question of parentage;
and the citizen equally inherited, with his blood,
responsibilities towards the community into which
he was born, as to a larger kindred.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

Membership of the tribe or of the city was the
only qualification, that admitted to the privilege and
duty of partaking in the public religious observances.
Tribesmen and citizens, by virtue of their privilege,
shared in the worship of the greater gods, of Hestia
in the Prytaneum, of Zeus Agoraios, and of the
Heroes or special guardians of their community;
in like manner as the member of the smaller group
of a kindred, by virtue of his blood, shared in the
worship of the Apollo Patroïos, the Zeus Herkeios or
Ktesios, and the heroes or ancestors of his family.
Inasmuch as citizenship depended upon purity of
descent, the possession of the latter qualification
carried with it the right to share in the greater
ceremonies. But the converse was equally stringent,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg 139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in that the possession of shrines of Apollo Patroïos
and Zeus Herkeios was impossible, unless the family
was one of those who had for many generations been
recognised as belonging to the true stock of the
community.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

Inasmuch as the worship of private or public
gods consisted mainly of offerings of food, of beasts
or produce of the earth, and wine, every tribesman
or citizen must have had the means of providing his
share in the offerings, besides supporting himself and
his family. Those devoted to handicraft or merchandise
were often despised by the regular tribesman or
citizen, and sometimes therefore formed separate clans
by themselves, like the smiths in Arabia. It is not
surprising, therefore, to find that the membership of
the tribe or city should have carried with it the right
to the possession of some portion of the arable land
and of the pasture, upon which all were regarded as
being dependent. In this way the possession of land
was intimately related to the status and the duties
of the owner. It was the visible mark of his full
tribal privilege, and was the practical means of his
fulfilling his duty towards his fellows and the public
religion, as well as to the needs of his ancestors and
household. It seems also to have been believed
that, in partaking of the hospitality or sharing in
the sacrificial feast of any family, a bond was for
the time being created which was in most respects
practically equivalent to relationship by blood to
the members of that family.<a id="noteref_350" name="noteref_350" href="#note_350"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">350</span></span></a>

Apart from the tribal character of the qualification
for citizenship, the most conservative organisation
wherein had been stereotyped the most precious of
tribal customs, was that of the kindred.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is suggested that the vitality of the customs
surrounding the bond of family relationship was due
to the importance attached to the religious and social
functions incumbent on all members of a household
united by kindred blood. The actions of the individual
members were constrained by their weighty
responsibilities towards the continuance and prosperity
of the composite household, in which they moved, and
apart from which their existence could not but be
altogether incomplete.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The worship of ancestors occupied a prominent
place in the needs of the Athenian household, and, no
doubt, had a corresponding influence in the preservation
of its unity. The same of course cannot be
said for Wales, where Christianity had replaced, in the
records at any rate, whatever religious beliefs may
have existed earlier. But the grouping of the kindred
according to grades of relationship was adhered to by
the Welsh as an intrinsic part of their very conception
of a kindred; and this would point to the conclusion
that such subdivisions were due to wider needs than
can be found in any particular form of religious
belief or worship.

If, as has been suggested, in adhering to these
customs, the Greeks were still treading in the tracks
of their tribal ancestors, how is it that the most
convincing evidence comes from as late as the fifth
and fourth centuries <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">B.C.</span></span> and mainly from the most

The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Iliad</span></span> and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Odyssey</span></span> may perhaps be
trusted as truly portraying, so far as they go, the
manners and customs of the great period of Achaian
civilisation, known as Mycenean, which may be said
to have culminated just before the Dorian invasion.
Whence then came the public recognition of those
household ceremonies of ancestor-worship, which filled
such a large place in the life of the Athenian citizen,
and which, it has been suggested, were consciously
or unconsciously slurred over by the Homeric
poets?

long cherished customs of the ancient Ionian or
Pelasgian inhabitants of Greece, who had formed the
substratum of society under Achaian rule, and who
only came into prominence on the removal of their
superiors at the time of the Dorian invasion. And
this continuity, underlying the superficial rule of the
Achaians, seems to be borne out by recent research
and discovery.<a id="noteref_352" name="noteref_352" href="#note_352"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">352</span></span></a>

In the course of argument reference has often
been made to the Jewish records in the Books of the
Old Testament, and indeed a remarkable parallel is
presented in the history of the two peoples. Both
peoples apparently reached their greatest period
about the same time. The reign of Solomon with
its gold and costly workmanship must have resembled
that of the Mycenean kings in more than similarity
of date, and outward splendour. Taking Homer
again as the courtly chronicler of the Achaian age of
gold, the Books of the Kings of both peoples are
curiously conscious of their former tribal conditions,
through which they easily trace back to the very
fountain-head of their race.

In the period of the decay of the Jewish people
under the stress of invasion by foreign kings, strenuous
efforts were made by their prophet leaders to
purge them from the alien blood and alien influences
contracted in the careless days of their prosperity.
Their aim was to restore once more those strict tribal
habits which had served them so well at the time of
their own victorious invasion, and which still lay dormant
in their constitution. In similar wise, the period
of Achaian prosperity seems to have been followed by
a rise into prominence at any rate, if not an actual
resuscitation, of old tribal customs.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
</p><div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">These tribal habits probably only dormant
throughout and common to all Greeks,</span></div></div><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The actual traces of tribal institutions in Homer
need not be underrated. There is much that is of a
tribal character in the Homeric chieftain in his relations
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg 143]</span><a name="Pg143" id="Pg143" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to his tribesmen and to their gods. Survivals
of tribal custom may also be seen in the reverence
for the guest, and the sacredness of the bond of
hospitality lasting as it did for generations; and in
the blood-feud with its deadly consequences, especially
when occurring within the tribe or kindred. Indeed
if only the Pentateuch of the Achaians could be found
in the ruins of Mycenae and added to the Homeric
Book of the Kings, would it not then probably be
evident that there was much more of a tribal nature
in the organisation of the kindreds of the Achaians
and surviving throughout the whole period of their
splendour than the aristocratic poets of the Homeric
schools allowed themselves to record?

Although therefore nearly all our evidence of the
internal structure of the kindred among the Greeks
dates from the fifth century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">B.C.</span></span>, the ἀγχιστεία at
Athens must not be put down as belonging merely to
that period. In the light of the close analogies to
be found in the structure of other tribal systems,
it is probable that such subdivisions of the kindred
belong to an extremely early period in the history
of the Greeks, whether as Achaians or Ionians or
Dorians. Are they not indeed necessary features of
tribal society itself wherever it is examined?

A. The tribe (φυλή) of the

treasurers and led by the priest of
Artemis, decide to purchase from
Thraseas, son of Polites son of
Melas of Grab ... and adopted
son of Heracleitos son of Heracleides
of Ogonda, lands (γέας) in the
Ombian plain with the sixty-two
ranks of vines, three olive trees,
and all the other trees without
reserve, also lands elsewhere with
the trees without reserve for 5,000
drachmae of light Rhodian silver,
provided that Thraseas has the
sale registered with sureties.
Moreover, Thraseas coming to the
ekklesia declared that he was ready
to manage these things: and the
sale having taken place of the said
(properties) to the trustees in the
name of the god. Thraseas himself
then and there took on lease

the treasurers of the tribe: and
he shall hold them (εἰς πατρικά)

issue or those to whomsoever the
inheritance of his goods passes,

treasurers of the tribe 100 and ...
drachmae, without fail or fraud.

Artemisia, daughter of Hekataios

in these places either in the
matter of the share he took in the
division with his brother or of
what he bought from Artemisia, all
for 7,000 drachmae of light silver
of Rhodes, provided that Thraseas
register the sale and give sureties.
And coming before the ekklesia
Thraseas declared that he was
prepared to manage this; and the
sale of the foregoing having taken
place to the trustees in the name
of the god, Thraseas himself then
and there took on lease all the
foregoing from the treasurers of
the tribe: and he shall hold them

            IRS.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
            charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
            States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
            considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
            with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
            we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
            DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
            visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate" class="tei tei-xref">http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate</a></p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
            have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
            against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
            approach us with offers to donate.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
            any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
            outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and
            addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including

            originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that
            could be freely shared with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and
            distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer
            support.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of
            which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright
            notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in
            compliance with any particular paper edition.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
            eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
            compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Corrected <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">editions</span></em> of our eBooks replace the old file
